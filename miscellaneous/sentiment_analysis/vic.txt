0.066 |  Commuting or staying on the campus I have a feeling my parents(read dad) wouldn't allow me to live on campus, I'm still gonna fill out the form to be on the safe side. But mostly I think I'll have to commute.  I wanted to know if I'll have to apply for the dorms of the college I chose or if I can choose other residences ? I applied to vic as my first choice.   I heard there are mixed washrooms and no fking way I want that and If the dorms are worth the ridiculous cost which residence might be better?

0.028 |  Will i survive next year? Hi so this is going to be a bit of a ramble. I've been accepted into UofT at Vic college for social science and I'm so excited! I'm nervous though as my mom says UofT is so competitive that I won't be able to make friends or continue dating my girlfriend. Is it still possible to date and have friends and do extra curriculars at UofT in social science?

0.058 |  My experience with being locked out of residence at UofT Victoria College Annesley Hall It's been 3 years now and this experience still appears in my head at night, so I thought of creating a reddit account and posting it. Hopefully, I can stop thinking about it.  This was in my first year, when COVID19 was a thing in China, but not in other countries yet. Mainly just felt upset on how little these people care about their students. Hopefully you guys have a better dean now and no one else experienced or have to experience what I experienced.  Basically what happened is that in the middle of winter in 2020, sometime after12:30am I left my room to use the shared washroom. I took my keycard and not my phone and It was during the weekends so my roommate left to live with her parents. When I came back I realize the keycard doesn't work anymore, again. Given how much we spend and the rate that the keycard breaking is pretty ridiculous (really hope they changed the keycards now). So I was in panic and decided to ask the student dean living at this floor. I knock and she opened. I know she has a masterkey and asked if she can open my room for me. She said she can't because she is not allowed to and I might not live here. I said I'm in pajamas and slippers and holding my broken keycard in the middle of a winter night. She said she is not allowed to help me and told me to go get my keycard fixed in the building that does it. The place to do that is outside of the resident and going out without a keycard means I'm locked out. I said it's snowing, windy and negative degrees and I'm in my pajamas. She just told me to go and closed the door on me.   I remembered my roommate, who experienced similar things to me. It was on the weekends when I wasn't in residence. She had her period and panicked out the door. Didn't bring her pants or her keycard. The dean said that she isn't allowed to used the keycard and that she couldn't tell if she is an outsider (yep, an outsider coming in in the middle of winter with no pants and a pajama top). Then she  remember her friend said something similar happened and their dean (the first floor dean) used her masterkey to help. So she went and lucky the first floor dean was there and helped her out.  For me, not so lucky, the first floor dean wasn't there. So there are two options for me, to go to the building to get my keycard renewed or find another way. Took some time and mental break downs but I remembered from the back of my head that I could press 0 on any phones from the building and someone would come and help me. Did so and someone came with a masterkey and got in my room.  Next morning went to get my keycard fixed, and it turns out the Goldring student center was locked and at that time I didn't know how to go to the building for the keycards without going pass the Goldring student center. Even with boots and a winter coat I was freezing. Took about 30mins for me to find out I could just walk past the student center and get to my destination.  Later in the weekdays, I went to the student center and told them my experience and my roommate's. The purpose was to tell them how unfitting the dean was, problems with their system, and ask for an apology. They promised an in person apology from the dean and I can tell you it did not and will not happen. I could tell he didn't really care until I told him that if I went out that night and realize the student center was closed. I would probably just run to KFC and ask them to call 911. That was when he immediately said there is no need to call 911 and started to act like he cared. It's funny cuz he was helping the dean explain to me and also said stuff like she couldn't tell if I was actually living there. And when I said I was in pajamas, slippers, and holding my keycard he just changed the topic. He was basically saying now this already happened to you and your roommate and there is nothing we can do to change it, so we should only focus on how can we avoid it for other people. So the only difference is that there is a paper on the dean's door with the full phone number and good luck memorizing that number if you have to use one of the residence's phone.

I got into university of toronto st. george campus mathematical and physical sciences as well as victoria college yesterday, and I was wondering how the scholarships work?  So basically I am a international student and I don't think I have any info about the scholarships on my admission letter. I emailed the victoria college registrarial office and they said it would have been noted on my offer letter if I recieved an admissions scholarships. Does it mean that they are not offering me any entrance scholarship from u of t or victoria college?

0.088 |  I am so confused!!!!!!!!!! I have a 96% average and I applied in November. I finished my Victoria College supp app much ahead of the Dec 15 deadline. Yesterday, I got into UofT Mississauga campus life science and St.George campus kinesiology, which I‚Äôm very proud of. But my application for UofT SG life science is still under review when a lot of people with lower averages than mine got in yesterday.  1. Does this mean I‚Äôm not getting in at all? 2. Is it because I also applied to UTM for the same program? Can they only give me an offer from one campus for that program? 3. If my supp App for Victoria College is not that good, will they still consider me for other colleges?  4. Do they let you know if you‚Äôre not accepted in the first round and deferred to the next round? Or does the status stay ‚Äúapplication under review‚Äù? Please let me know‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm going crazy
0.029 |  Question abt colleges and scholarships I just got my offer of admission for the main St George campus for U of T (humanities), and had a couple of questions:  \- How is University College like? I applied for Victoria College but I guess I didn't get it because it wasn't on my letter of admission (is there an acceptance/rejection letter for vic since there's a separate application?), feeling a little depressed about it so can anyone let me know if the colleges really matter and if UC is just as good?  \- When do I know if I got a scholarship or not? Maybe I just didn't receive any since I had indicated I wasn't in need of financial aid, but I have read other threads of people saying they received a scholarship notif for the main campus a week to a month after their admission letter was sent. I got scholarships for the two other campuses in the letters so wanting to know if its a waiting game or not lol  I just got my offer of admission to the main St George campus for U of T (humanities), and had a couple of questions: Any other advice for me going into U of T would be greatly appreciated!

0.0 |  Does your college matter if you don't live in residence? I'm a student at UTSC, but I'm transferring to St George next year for Life Sci at Victoria College   I don't really know anything about the whole "college system" at St George, I kind of just ranked them at random. I'll be living off campus and I'm not going to get a meal plan so I didn't think much of it.  I know that your college is mainly just for residence (and also like billing and registars office etc) but does it really matter which college your in beyond that?   Is there any significant difference between them? (Besides the college specific uoft merch they sell lol)

0.028 |  Desperate for admissions advice- please help! Chances of Getting In and How To Improve That Chance  Hi!  I‚Äôm interested in applying for UTSG for the arts program and hopefully get into Trinity or Victoria.  I need some advice on my marks though.  In highschool I took 2 4U/M courses and 1 alternative education course each semester because of some mental health stuff.   So my Grade 12 looked like this:  English 93 Visual Arts 93 95  Business Leadership 95  Then 2 Grade 10 Alternative Education Class    A year later, I took 2 classes one after another in adult high school. Added: Data 94 International Business 68 (Wasn‚Äôt feeling great when I took this course)  Another year later, I retook the International Business. It became: International Business 93  I‚Äôve been doing things other than highschool courses and know that supplementary things count on the application but I just want to focus on the grades in this post.   So here I am 2.5 years out of highschool but I don‚Äôt know if the school will accept me because of the 68 since I heard they don‚Äôt like repeats.  I plan to explain why I did poorly in the special consideration form.  I‚Äôm also considered that they won‚Äôt think I can handle the school because I took maximum 2 4U/M at a time.  I am in a much better place so I know I can now though.  Should I put that in the special consideration form that I had mental health issues so I had to space it out?  Or would that make it worse?  If I take another 4U/M course, get a good mark and replace International Business in my Top 6, will it help?  My mom went to Trinity so I‚Äôm kind of interested in applying.  I think it will give me an advantage because of my mom but I don‚Äôt know if they will even consider me because of my previous concerns listed.  Do you think I should even bother?  I heard the admission requirement is a 98 in Trinity but I‚Äôm not sure about Victoria.   Thank you for reading and any advice would be greatly appreciated!

0.0 |  Vic Student Profile Questions Would a 3-month long fellowship program count as a 'regular activity' for the question about regular activities outside school?

I want to pursue economics, but I'd like to take finance and math courses too, so do I tick the checkboxes for those as well?  If y'all have any other tips for answering the two essay questions in the profile (One's about 3 regular activites you've participated in outside school and the other one's about why you want to join Vic), please feel free to share those as well!

0.0 |  Innis and Victoria College for Health Sciences I'm working on my application to the University of Toronto but I'm a bit apprehensive about which specific colleges I should rank. I want to study Molecular Genetics and Microbiology as an int student and I want research to be a pivotal part of my undergraduate experience. I don't think any college has an overarching academic theme. Aside from academics, I'd rather have a college with a small student body and a meal plan, but I'm willing to make an exception for Innis because the building is my favorite, I'm in love with modern minimalist spaces.   Any tips or college recommendations? If anyone's from Innis and Victoria, what do you think of the student atmosphere there?

0.012 |  VIC106 Review (Vic One Program) So I've been looking for reviews for seminar courses, and I discovered that there aren't any. I have also learned this semester that seminar courses can be hella tedious and a lot of work/reading, while others are really laid back and easy to do.   VIC106 is a really good first year seminar. It has one small assignment, one big assignment, and one final test. They are all based on writing essays about the books we read. So honestly, if you are really really realllyyy against wriitng, then yeah don't take this. Also, if you aren't a fan of reading a whole lot, remember that the world is a nice place and you can use Sparknotes, LitChart, etc.   I am a very science and math oriented person and i dont like reading and writing, but I thought this course was really fun to take, so I definitely think you should if you have the chance. The course instructor( professor Joel Faflak) is super nice.  I finished with an A, and I bet that as long as you follow along during the seminar, participate, and do your essays, you can be successful with the course. I will be taking another seminar course this semester and write another review for future first years!  I give this course a 4.5/5.0
0.058 |  Victoria College Profile? I put Victoria College 1st for the top 3 colleges ranking, as I heard it was one of the top colleges, but I'm really not knowledgeable or keen about any of them.

And is there anything that actually distinguishes the colleges from each other, because if this college is worth writing a supplement for then I suppose I might as well. Thanks :(

0.06 |  UofT St George College Residence Choices Hi! I was accepted for LifeSci in Victoria College and want to major/specialise in psych hopefully... but after more research realised most rooms are double rooms and not single rooms.   Would it be possible for me to switch colleges to maybe Trinity (where most dorms are single)? Or elsewhere? I‚Äôd love if my residence was close to the classes I‚Äôd be taking.   The college picking process is seriously stressful because I‚Äôm an international student so I can‚Äôt go and visit the residences.   Thanks for any help!
0.022 |  People in Vic One Frye Stream - Questions from a high school senior Hi!   After getting feedback/information from a few helpful people about Vic One in general, I‚Äôm mostly leaning towards applying for the Northrop Frye stream.   I‚Äôve done research on it and the courses involved in the Frye stream, but I was hoping there would be a few people out there willing to help by giving me their own personal experiences about this stream (or Vic One in general; any help is welcome!). What did you mostly do in the four courses that are a part of the Frye Stream, what did you like/dislike, did you dislike that it was 2.0 FCE/took up most space of electives (as far as I‚Äôve heard?), etc.   Thanks and I hope to hear from people soon!

The problem is, I'm still a bit confused about how things work. I was hoping someone could give me a run down of Vic One/Vic One Hundred (is there a difference?). Does it take over how a "regular" first year would go? Should I take it, or will it make things harder on me? Any other bits of information about this would help me greatly!   Thank you and I hope to hear back from people soon!

0.031 |  Which college is the best for me? So I applied to UofT to do my undergraduate in life sciences starting in fall 2020 at St. George, but I'm not sure if the colleges I ranked are good. I get that the college choice doesn't matter that much in terms of the classes you'll be taking, but I'm planning on living on campus, so I'm wondering which college has the best residence life for its price. Most of the posts I could find on this topic were from a few years ago, so apologies if I'm repeating what other people said.  I'm looking for something modern with very affordable pricing including meal plans. My current choices are 1. Victoria College, 2. University College, 3. St. Michael's College. I feel like I had to choose either Victoria or Trinity for no. 1 since they are deemed the best, without thinking much about the cost. I also regret the fact that I didn't choose either New College or Woodsworth since they are both more modern than the other options.  Are my choices good for what I'm looking for? Or should I change them before it's too late (hopefully without additional cost on OUAC). Thanks!

0.0 |  Which college should I apply to if I want an apartment style res? Hi, I'm a grade 12 student applying into Life Science at St. George Campus and wanted opinions on which apartment-style college to apply to? I'm not too much of a party student and I would like for res to be close to where classes would be. I was considering vic but read that it's far from where classes are at.   Side note, is St. Michael College super religious?  And thoughts on NC vs. UC?
0.025 |  Unpopular Opinion: The College System I‚Äôve been thinking recently about how the college system is one of their main ways establishing communities among students at UofT, since the school is so large.   However, that got me thinking, do issuing students into a college deflect the community that can exist at other schools? For example, my friend at Western University feels able/free to go to any residence, dining hall, and student building without thinking. On the other hand, at UofT, I have noticed many (myself included) students who are/make themselves restricted to their college in terms of friends, food, and places to study/relax at. Even subconsciously, I feel like I *have* to resort to my own specific college to hang out after class, even though I theoretically could go wherever (I don‚Äôt live on campus for reference).  For example, as a member of Trinity College, I feel as if I not welcomed to go to the Goldring Student Centre at Vic because I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt belong there.‚Äù (I bet you reading the fact I go to Trinity might have put a thought in your brain that I could be an ‚Äúelitist, salty and a dickhead‚Äù person even though I try to never replicate those characteristics in my actual life.)  I in fact really appreciate Victoria College, and think their facilities/approach to many things are better than my own college - even UC, New, St. Mikes, WW and (of course) Innis do certain things right BUT because I am not part of them, I feel as if I can never, or will ever, be able to use these ‚Äúschool-wide‚Äù facilities.  I am not saying colleges are a bad idea, I am just wishing students should be taught about ALL the different places around campus among every colleges and school building and be given more access as both an on-res, near-res and off campus student.

0.014 |  So which college should I go for? Hi. Grade 12 here, going to apply via OUAC soon.  I went on a tour of the place in Spring, and I had no idea about the seven colleges system until then. Our guide was from Victoria College I think, and she was talking about how some colleges will only admit you if you rank them first, and that some will require essays/supplementary applications as well?  I guess my question is which colleges should I look into? I want to live in a more traditional residence with roommates/common areas, and getting a meal plan is a must for me as well. I'm interested in computer science, so on the off chance that I get into that super competitive program I'd probably like one that's situated near the comp sci classes/buildings.  Thanks for any input you have!

0.024 |  Residence Choice for First Year (English Major) Hey everybody, so I'm currently a grade 12 student and I'm just starting to look into applications and such, I'm currently filling out the form for U of T and I'm asked to rank the colleges from most to least interested in. I'm planning to go into Humanities (English major) and I've heard that Vic would be the best choice, but I've looked into Woodsworth's residences and they look so much cleaner and modern than most colleges so I'm really torn between the two. And I know this might sound picky but I grew up having my own bedroom and can't imagine having a roommate, so which college you reckon would have the highest chance of offering a single room for a first year like me?  (I've also heard that you'll need to fill in an additional application for Vic, can anyone confirm this?)  And if you have any more helpful suggestions please inform me about them, I'd be super grateful for anything (little tips/secrets) that might help guide me through uni next year!! :D

0.101 |  a very original post - U of T or Mcgill Hi everyone, this is super late and probably annoying but I desperately need help. I've been accepted to arts at both McGill and U of T. Through a lot of weaselling, I have managed to delay my choice until the literal last minute. Ok, here are the details. I am from BC, and Ive just finished my gap year. I would be studying either literature, anthropology, political sci, or classics at either place. Im not super sure which yet.   The pros, for me, of Mcgill are as follows: -Beautiful Campus, awesome city with lots of green space   \- My dad is from the area, so I have family around Montreal/ the south shore  \- My best friends both go to Mcgill, they're entering second year (could be a con depending on how you look at it)  \-Cheaper. With the exception of first year, it would cost a lot less to live in Montreal for 4 years.   \- Mayeb better for my mental health, as there is an existing support system there and I greatly fear the transition to university.  cons:  \- less communal seeming than u of t (no colleges) so maybe more anonymous?  \- I worry about getting locked into the same social seen from high school.   \- I'm not hyped about the school.  U of T pros:  \- I would be a part of Trinity college, and the Vic one frye stream. This seems like the sort of decent oxfordian lifestyle that could be awesome.   \-Seems to have better programs? I'm not totally sure because rankings are subjective   \- Chance to totally reinvent myself   Cons:  \- Super expensive to live in Toronto, I don't know how anyone affords it on a student budget.  \-I don't know anyone in the province of Ontario   \-I don't know Toronto well, but I don't know if I love it.   \-I've heard pretty nasty rumours about the undergrad experience there (ie: mentally devastating, impersonal, hardcore)  Basically Toronto seems like a more high risk, possibly high reward scenario whereas Montreal might be safer.

0.02 |  Share Your UofT Tips Here! Spread the Knowledge on what UofT offers it's Students EDIT: I'm gonna update this post as much as I can and submit a final list to the mods so that they can hopefully pin it to the top of this sub. Keep posting your tips!  EDIT 2: I love the fact that people are coming up with so much stuff. But let's keep this on topic please. While the discounts at various stores online or otherwise are definitely amazing, this post was meant to list the things the UNIVERSITY offers to us for free(or what we're already paying for!)  For example, in a [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/cgrgvr/i_understand_if_you_want_to_opt_out_of_some/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) in this community, a lot of us got to know that SEC offers free sex-related resources and supplies like condoms, lubricant etc.  Another example: I(an incoming first year engineering student) was talking to an upper-year student about buying a printer. Only then I got to know that engineers can print upto 1000 pages per year for free at the Sandford Fleming building.  It turns out that all the resources that we pay for aren't properly advertised by UofT and this is leading to most of us opting out of most of the incidental fees.  Everyone please try to share ANYTHING that you feel can be useful to another student. It could be a lesser known resource that the university offers (like SEC resources) that we've already paid for, or even just a small piece of advice which could potentially save us time/money/energy/headaches.  &amp;#x200B;  Edit(s): Some more tips:  * Get a 3% cashback on your tuition fee if you use PayTM. * You can stream media free of cost here: [https://mediacommons.library.utoronto.ca/criterion-demand](https://mediacommons.library.utoronto.ca/criterion-demand).

0.0 |  Course enrolment advice (first year humanities) Hello, a first year humanities student here and course enrolment opens up for me on Thursday 9:15am. I‚Äôve read that for some people course enrolment opens up way earlier. So just to confirm, does everyone have different timings? And I want to take the seminar courses trn199 (fall) and vic109 (winter) and I‚Äôm not enrolled in either Vic or Trinity one. So I can‚Äôt enrol until after Aug 2nd. Do I have a chance in enrolling in these courses before they fill up? And should I enrol in 2 other (backup) courses (worth 1 credit) when course enrolment opens just incase I don‚Äôt get in them?
0.028 |  Need help with schedule (first year) Hey everyone, course enrollment is approaching and I could really use some help on my schedule... I am currently intending on majoring in computer science and neuroscience.  Here is my current planned¬†schedule:   Fall:¬†   BIO120, CSC108, PSY100, MAT137,CHM135   Winter:   CSC165,CSC148, MAT137, BIO130,CHM136,SMC199 (I have to take a small class in Victoria but I was told I could ask to waive it in case I cannot manage the workload)  I got approval from the departments of chemistry and biology to take the courses Bio130, BIO120, CHM135 and CHM136 without having the highschool prerequisites (I'm an international student and had a different school system).  So these courses would probably be even harder for me...  Should I take Mat137 or will it be too much for me to handle?  What are my chances of getting the computer science courses out of stream? How hard are the biology courses (I know the chemistry ones are supposed to be quite tough)? Has anyone done smc199?  I would really appreciate if you could give your opinion in general, also any recommendations on professors and ones to avoid would be really appreciated  Thank you thank you and I wish you all an awesome year!

0.102 |  The truth about Trinity So I'm an incoming first-year student and I've been accepted to Trinity College. Sadly, I didn't do my homework before indicating Trin as my first choice college -- in my defence, the decision between Trinity and Victoria was entirely arbitrary and I didn't expect to end up at UofT, to be completely honest -- and now I'm seriously worried after reading about all the weird traditions at the college and its bad rap. I just want to know if this is true. Are most Trin people really elitist and snobbish? Will I have this stigma attached to me from day 1 even if I'm not elitist in any way? Does the ambiance of the college make people uncomfortable?  Also, I opted out of Trin Orientation (because I'm a hermit haha) but will I still be able to go to the Matriculation Convocation if I want to? And is the residence really that terrible?  Please help a confused first-year out.  Thanks in advance.

0.009 |  Newbie Questions! Newbie entering Art Sci this september at victoria college :D got some questions regarding UofT in general:  1. How can you check transferral credits for IB? I tried using the transfer explorer app on UofT and honestly, I'm still not sure how to work that out. Do I have to reach out to UofT myself to check with them or will they send in letters?  2. Can I attend tutorials for courses I plan to take? For example I want to take international relations program, but I want to get a headstart by going to their tutorials - do I have to be in the program/enrolled in the course to attend the tutorials? Or could I just enrol for tutorials only?  3. What are the most popular clubs / student organisations around UofT?  I'd be super grateful if anybody could answer :D

0.023 |  Best vic one hundred seminar I need to choose a vic one hundred seminar class but I‚Äôm not sure which one is the best or easiest. Which ones did you like and what stuff did you learn? I know I have to choose what I‚Äôm interested in but I just want an idea.   My degree already requires me to do a lot of courses that satisfy the 2nd category of breadth. So, I would prefer to choose one that satisfies the 3rd category (society and it‚Äôs institutions)

0.016 |  Need help with schedule (first year) Hey everyone, course enrollment is approaching and I could really use some help on my schedule... I am debating between majoring in cogsci with neuroscience or compsci and maybe physics instead. I am trying to keep my options open and that explains this odd mix of courses...  Here is my current planned¬†schedule:   Fall:¬†   PHY131, CSC108, CSC165, MAT135,CHM135   Winter:   PHY132,CSC148, MAT136, BIO130,CHM136,VIC135 (have to take a small class in Victoria but I was told I could ask to waive it in case I cannot manage the workload)  I got approval from the departments of chemistry and biology to take the courses Bio130 and CHM135 and CHM136 without having the highschool prerequisites (I'm an international student and had a different school system).  So these courses would probably be even harder for me...  I am also thinking of taking MAT137 instead of 135 and 136 as it is recommended to take with the cs courses and because I am very interested in math but afraid that all together it will be too much. I thought that taking both a biology and chemistry course in the first semester when I don't have the prerequisites might be too much so that is why I put csc165 on the first term.   I would really appreciate if you could give your opinion in general, also any recommendations on professors and ones to avoid would be really appreciated  Thank you thank you and I wish you all an awesome year!

0.017 |  Does anyone know what mattresses are in the residence halls? I lived in residence about 5 or 6 years ago, and one thing I noticed is that I liked the mattresses there more than my own mattress at home (which I had specifically selected for myself, so clearly I made a bad choice). Now, I already graduated, and I don't know if they still use the same mattresses now that they used then, but I decided it might be worth a shot here. I lived in Margaret Addison Hall, but as far as I remember, most residences had the same mattress, and it was a foam mattress of some kind. It might be time to replace my mattress soon, so I decided to look into that right now.

0.013 |  Vic One or Trin One? Hello, I am about to enter U of T in the faculty of Social Sciences. I was just accepted to the Pearson stream of Vic One, and the Ethics, Society, and Law stream of Trin One. I'd like to decide between the two, but I am unsure about certain specifics of them. I'd like to major in Political Science, and potentially double major in Computer Science as well, but I'd settle for a minor in Com Sci. I have a few questions, and I would be very thankful if you could answer any one of them:  1) What are the major differences between "Trin One Ethics, Society, and Law" and "Vic One Pearson?" (courses, teaching style, workload, subject, etc)  2) How many FCE's does Trin One require, and how many FCE's does Vic One require?  3) Would taking any of these two "One" programs prevent me from either getting a Political Science/Computer Science double major, and would taking any of these two "One" programs prevent me from minoring in Com Sci?

0.052 |  Need to get out of SMC ASAP I have had nothing but terrible experiences with all but two of the SMC registrars.

The thing is, I'm going to my fourth year and I want to graduate in a year's time. I also don't know which college I should apply to. If it makes a difference, I have a competitive cGPA and it wouldn't hurt if I could scoop up some money from the college I transfer to.  I know I will need help from the registrar this upcoming year and the thought of having to walk over to that God-awful college is really unsettling.   Would really appreciate some advice on which college I could go to. I've emailed Innis, Vic, and UC asking if they'd consider an application and so far only Innis turned me down.

My ultimate goal is med school (I know, really unrealistic but let a girl dream lol) but I'm trying to keep my options open so I'm considering pharmacy school as well as other pathways. Since pharmacy requires an university english course &amp; my vic college membership requires a small class size course, those took up my electives.  &amp;#x200B;  Also, for labs, do they alternate depending on the last digit of the lab course code?

0.064 |  Trying to choose between UBC and U of T Hello! I'm in my last year of high school (almost finished!) and I'm trying to decide which university to go to for my undergrad. I am interested in the Arts - Sciences have never really been my "thing" - but I'm not sure specifically what I want to go into yet. For this reason, I want to go into a big university that has a lot of variety in programs so I can find something that I really like and am passionate about. UBC and U of T both fit into this category, but they're so similar that I can't seem to choose between them. I also take the IB Diploma Program, if this helps you with giving me advice (does anyone know exactly how much I can drop in my exams for both universities by the way...?)  &amp;#x200B;  I live in Vancouver, so going to UBC would mean staying close to home. When I first started thinking about universities to go to, my first thought was that I wanted to go somewhere relatively far, so I could be independent (my family is kind of crazy; I have 3 younger brothers, so a little change of pace would be nice). U of T immediately stuck out for me because of this; since it's also a larger city, it seems more exciting and fast-paced than Vancouver as well. Although Vancouver is really nice, it can get kind of boring sometimes, and I'm also searching for something new.  &amp;#x200B;  Academically, both universities have what I'm looking for. As I mentioned before, since I'm not totally sure on what I want to do, the fact that both have a lot of programs is really good for me. In addition to this, I've heard that undergrad education isn't really that different in universities across Canada, so I'm not worried about a difference in quality between the two universities. Neither university is offering a course that isn't offered at the other one, which makes my decision harder.  &amp;#x200B;  Another big factor for my during this decision is the environment. Not just the natural environment, but also the social one. However, the temperature in Toronto is a big factor for me (although I know it's silly and that it really shouldn't be). I've never been very good with the cold (I think that -2 degrees is freezing), so seeing that Toronto can drop to -30 degrees Celsius is not very comforting. Is it worth the cold/wind?  &amp;#x200B;  However, disregarding the weather, Toronto is a lot more culturally diverse than Vancouver, which is something that I was excited about when I was researching it. I'm worried that I won't be able to enjoy this as much as I'd like to, however, as I've read a lot of things online (specifically here, on Reddit) that say that the social scene at U of T is not so good. I consider myself a pretty social person most of the time, and I don't want my university career to consist of solely studying and absolutely nothing else. It seems that U of T is more academically rigorous than UBC, and although my studies are the most important thing to me, I also don't want to be robbed of a social life. Is the social scene at UBC/U of T any good? I haven't really heard any good things about either, but I've also seen a lot of people say that it is what you make of it, which I guess is true for any school.  &amp;#x200B;  Anyways, I'm really really torn between the two schools, and it seems that I'm swayed by any opinion that comes my way because I'm extremely indecisive. I feel that every opinion I get sways me to either school, and it ends up being like a game of Ping-Pong, where I'm just jumping back and forth between the two schools. I know that in the end, this is my decision and it's really what I make of it, but I'd really like to hear you guys' opinions. Hopefully I can read them without being easily swayed to one side or the other.  &amp;#x200B;  EDIT: I forgot to mention, I also really want to do exchange in my 3rd year. I got accepted into Victoria College at UT, and I heard that it has a really good financial aid program. Is the UBC exchange program any better, or is it the same?

0.034 |  Residence Hey I just made it and got accepted to uoft Social Sciences. But my average was around a 86%. But my midterm will bring my average up to around 89-90%. But the thing that I‚Äôm kind of worried about is the fact that I got accepted with that average into University College. If my mark is higher by midterm will I be able to get into Victoria College. Please let me know how I can get into Victoria College I really want to be apart of it. 
0.018 |  Residence for 1st Year Engineering I've ranked the residences as the following:  &amp;#x200B;  1. New College  2. University College  3. Innis  4. Victoria  5. Chesnut  6. St. Mikes  7. Loretto   8. Trinity   &amp;#x200B;  I've heard my top 3 choices are the closest to engineering buildings. Is that true?   &amp;#x200B;  If I do not get any of my top choices since they accept very few engineering students, how should I rank St. Mikes, Loretto, and Trinity? I don't like the religious scene at St. Mikes or Loretto, and I heard Trinity has bedbugs.  &amp;#x200B;  Also, can anyone share their experience at any of the residences? (how the food was, pros, cons, etc.)
0.0 |  Played myself. Applied to Trinity half because I want to be close to IR classes and half for the architecture.   Drumroll please... got into New College.  Obviously it's not a big deal and I'm greatfull to be accepted to the University in general, but I kind of wish I had just applied for Victoria or ranked University College as my top. Now I am neither in the IR hub or in a cool old looking building.
0.0 |  Engineering student needing advice on residences Hello all, first time on this sub. I‚Äôm applying to U of T (St. George campus) and I need some advice for choosing my residence by March 31st. I live in the US (I‚Äôm a Canadian citizen and I applied 105D so I get that nice tuition rate), and haven‚Äôt been able to tour the residences at U of T, so I need a little help if you wouldn‚Äôt mind, please.  My first-choice program is Engineering Science, second Mechanical Engineering, and third Chemical Engineering. I‚Äôd like to have fitness options in my residence as well.  My options are Chestnut Residence, Innis Residence (I‚Äôm leaning towards this one), New College Residence, St. Michael‚Äôs College, Trinity College Residence, University College Residence, and Victoria University Residence.  What do you guys think is the best residence option for a student like me?  Thank you!
0.053 |  which residence building should I rank first @ vic? When I visited them I liked upper burwash the best, but the tour guide said that there were a lot of upper years in it and that many first years put lower burwash as their first choice, is this true? I know that a lot of first years like margaret addison too. Personally, I love the architecture and location of upper and lower burwash. I also want to be in a very social environment because I can be pretty shy when I'm first meeting people and I think it'll be better if I'm out of my comfort zone right away. Plus, I don't mind a bit of partying :)))))))  &amp;#x200B;  thank you!!

Outside the classroom, I‚Äôm a person who plays a lot of sports (and hits the gym daily), does landscape photography, and likes to live near nature.

0.04 |  Another confused first year in need of assistance: do I enroll in courses for the summer? I‚Äôm in first year. I enrolled in English and Philosophy majors at the beginning of this school year (September). Next year I would like to major in English, minor in something else, and then minor in the Victoria College Education and Society program and do the CDP they offer. But, I didn‚Äôt take PSY100 this year, a prerequisite for that education minor. I want to take PSY over the summer so I can have the prerequisite and apply for the minor program second year. Do I stay enrolled in my current English and Philosophy majors over the summer if I do not intend to take any courses pertaining to those subjects over the summer? Really confused.

0.087 |  I‚Äôm a totally lost first year and I think I fucked up my chances at a really interesting program. Help? I‚Äôm a Victoria College student. I‚Äôve been stumbling through my first year not really knowing anything. I enrolled in the programs to major in English and philosophy to become a teacher eventually, and took some English and philosophy courses with some different courses outside of that (to fulfill credits, interests, to explore). My marks have been fine. I recently discovered the Vic CDP program, and found the road map for it as well. I didn‚Äôt take ANY of the programs required/recommended in my first year. I have had no idea what the fuck I‚Äôm doing here. The CDP in Education that Victoria College offers is very interesting to me and aligns with my goals pretty well. Did I fuck myself over by not paying attention to it earlier?   For reference, here is the roadmap I‚Äôve read: http://www.vic.utoronto.ca/Assets/VicCollege+Digital+Assets/Victoria+College/VicCollege+Digital+Assets/Principal/Academics/Infographics/combinedprograminfographic.pdf?method=1
0.0 |  Possible Incoming first year, need more info about Victoria College Hi y‚Äôall I just got accepted to compsci at UTSG so I‚Äôm stoked about that (but the average needed to pick compsci for second year has me concerned).   I didn‚Äôt really understand the college system when I applied, I did a little basic research on them and put Victoria because it sounded like it appealed what I like in a community.   However I‚Äôm learning now that might now have been the best choice. Although I don‚Äôt mind that it sounds like a more arts-leaning college and I‚Äôm cool with being around mostly arts ppl, it would be good to be around at least some compsci folks. Would I find any science/computer science students there?  I also didn‚Äôt realize how far away Vic is from the compsci classes. Can anyone in the know tell me approx how long it takes to walk from Vic to compsci classes?  Finally, is there any way to transfer colleges before first year starts? Thanks everyone :)   EDIT: I‚Äôm from bc, so I‚Äôll be living on residence - any pros or cons about living at Vic would be appreciated as well!

0.031 |  Any College suggestions aimed specifically for CompEng Undergrad Students? So, I managed to get accepted for the CompEng department with Scholars.  I am confused about what college is best for a computer engineering student. I want to find a place that offers me financial security (which I really need) in terms of scholarships in the future.   I want to find a housing place that can really encourage me to engage in club and leadership opportunities in the future, since I want to go into entrepreneurship in the future.   I really like the sound of Innis College, but I heard that scholarship money dries up in upper years. They don't offer meal plans, but I can cook.  Victoria sounds really nice, but I heard that it's only double room. I don't really want a roommate, and I'm willing to pay for it.  I'm a national by the way.

0.013 |  Incoming first year curious about Victoria College Hey guys! This is my first ever reddit post so I hope I do this right lol. Anyway, I'm a high school senior planning on attending UofT next year. My parents are making me stay in residency for my 1st year, and I ranked Victoria as my #1 choice. I just have a few questions about it that I couldn't find many answers to...  1. I ranked it my highest because I've read a lot about how it's full of friendly arts/humanities peeps (of which I am myself, haha). Can anyone confirm this? I'm kinda shy and am hoping to be surrounded by likeminded people :-) 2. It's a pretty prestigious college, right? Like I know it's the only one aside from Trinity that requires an application, plus it's one of the ones that you have to rank as #1 in order to be considered. Is it really that exclusive? 3. It's also pretty expensive compared to the other colleges. I know they dole out tons of scholarships and stuff but I'm wondering if the rooms/facilities/meal plans are worth the price? 4. This is just a general question about dorm life! I'm likely going to get a double room, is living with a roommate tricky to get used to? And how is the bathroom situation?  I think that's all for right now, any insight would be wonderful, thank you &lt;3

0.017 |  Choosing a College So needless to say, I'm in high school and planning to apply to UofT and I have to choose a college.  I plan on doing my undergrad in Chemistry and I'm debating between Trinity, Victoria, University, and New College. I won't be doing residence so my choice won't affect me as much but having a good student life would be nice.   Which of these would be most convenient as a science student as in how much walking would I have to do to get to classes?   And which of these offer the best scholarships for academic excellence? (I tried looking into this but there was so much to look at, so if anybody who knows could give me a tl;dr that'd be great)     Which one would you guys recommend overall?  &amp;#x200B;  From what I've already heard:  \- Trinity is the most prestigious  \- One guy said it'd show up on your degree that you graduated from Trinity  \- Some people have called Trinity a bit pretentious and that all the other colleges collectively jokingly hate on it lol  \- High table dinner where you have to dress up?     \- Victoria has great scholarships?  \- It's a bit far from classes depending on which ones you take  &amp;#x200B;  \- New College is pretty fucking amazing all around (Good library, support staff, convenient location, student body)  &amp;#x200B;  \- University College is pretty nice too, better than the remaining 3 at least imo

I'm sure there's no bad choice, but I appreciate anyone's insight!!

I'm looking into a minor of interest and their requirements are:  "... one full credit of the following first year courses: ANT100Y1 ‚Äì Introduction to Anthropology, any first year course in History, ¬†FAH101H1 ‚Äì Monuments Art History,¬†SOC101Y ‚Äì Introduction to Sociology, SOC102H1 - Introduction to Sociology Social Inequalities, SOC103H1 - Introduction to Sociology Social Institutions and Processes or *one credit from* the Vic One program."

0.0 |  Help an incoming first year student? Just a little bit of background info:  * I was in a non-semestered high school so I'm not used to the semestered system at all  * Victoria college student (Vic One Pearson stream too so I already have 2 credits filled up) * Looking to double major in politics and history (or specialist in politics and minor in history)  1. For full year courses (ex. POL101Y1Y) is there a mid term and an end of the year exam? Would the end of the year exam then be in spring? 2. Is the spring semester busier than the fall semester because of the end of the year exams? 3. Should you try and fulfill all the breadth requirement as early as possible?  4. When should I schedule labs/ tutorials? Before or after class? 5. The start time (thing they're supposed to give on July 20th) is basically a window period where you can pick courses right?   Literally any advice would help!

Do you know what kind of qualifications you need to earn their award/grant money?  I really enjoy going to the location and everyone there knows me by name. Heck, even Dave tutored me in MAT137. and everyone loves Dave from McDonald's. When I first met him he was big on Wendy's but boy after NFM I wouldn't be surprised if he wins the scholarship.  The best part is that I don't think it's based on grades but community involvement so I think I've got this in the bag. The to- go bag.  Anyone have more info on this money opp?

0.066 |  Change my mind, please Hello, I currently go to a high school in bc and recently I was accepted to the faculty of materials engineering and will be going this fall.  I chose u of t instead of ubc since I wanted to experience something different cus I‚Äôve lived my entire life in the lower mainland. However, the things I hear about u of t are mostly negative which are starting to worry me. Thus, I‚Äôm writing this post.  Some of my friends who went there for their band trip told me that most of the colleges are depressing and dirty since the showers are shared is that really true?\(especially Victoria college if I don‚Äôt get into new college\). I‚Äôve also heard that u of t doesn‚Äôt necessarily treat their students well\(fairly\) since they give more opportunities to ‚Äúsmart people‚Äù. Also i heard that it‚Äôs almost hard to make it to class on time if your in colleges other than new college for engineering since you can‚Äôt take a transit.   Another part I‚Äôm worried about is the engineering faculty building, is it depressing? And also are there lots of Chinese people? \(I just feel that if there are too many people that speak foreign languages I‚Äôd feel out of place and not even be able to have a conversation because it would be rude to interrupt)\The pictures I look up are really deceiving in my opinion that‚Äôs what my friend who went there also said. Also the studying environment, I‚Äôm not sure what to think at this point but I‚Äôve heard that its really competitive and easy to get distracted compared to McGill and ubc since it‚Äôs in downtown Toronto.  Will I be able to at least graduate if I try my best? I understand that many people can have different opinions and also biased ones since I‚Äôm in BC but with the information I have right now I feel like my life at u of t isn‚Äôt going to be a good one.  I would like to hear your opinions, thank you in advance. \&lt;3

0.012 |  UBC or UofT for Life Sciences? I got into UofT for Life Sciences (Vic) and UBC for Applied Biology and I'm having a hard time deciding where to go. At UofT I want to major in either Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology or Animal Physiology, and at UBC I'm majoring in Applied Animal Biology, and maybe grad school later for both.  Idk if they are related, but some pros/cons:   - I currently live near Vancouver, so I'm a lot more familiar with UBC. I've been to the UofT campus once.   - Most of my friends are going to UBC, but my sister studies at UofT so I won't be completely by myself for the first few months wherever I go.   - UBC has coop options.   - I got into the Land and Food Systems faculty at UBC, which is a fairly small faculty. Maybe more connections with professors??   - UofT has more research opportunities. The Summer Abroad opportunities for ecology especially interests me.   - Not much of a deciding factor, but I like the UofT campus and its aesthetics much better  Thanks in advance for any advice!

I was initially planning to apply for the Vic One Stowe-Gullen  stream but long story short - it didn't happen. Now, planning ahead, I know I want research opportunities at UofT, especially the ROPs in second year, and I'm wondering if, without the prof-relations and background knowledge about research that I would have otherwise learned in Vic One, are my chances of getting a ROP lower in any way?   I know that there are scholarships for Vic Nne students too that I assume they can put on their ROP app under the awards/achievements section. (But I obviously don't have that choice anymore) So that included, will my chances of obtaining a ROP at UTSG and garnering professor relations lowered now?   Thanks for any and all help!

Woodsworth One (Order &amp; Disorder): - co-curricular activities look good (are they though?) - takes up less credits than vic one? - work load is alright?  New One (languages &amp; diversity): - no co-requisites - haven't heard very much about it - kinda far from vic

0.015 |  Changing college choice to Vic before first year? To keep it brief, I'm a high school senior going into history in Fall 2018. I did some research for my college choices, but evidently not enough. Right now I'm admitted to UC, which is okay with me, but I think Vic's interdisciplinary focus and reputation for being good for humanities students makes it more attractive to me right now.  I would send an email, but Vic's website notes that all college choice changes have to be made through OUAC before Jan 17, which is long past.  In the end, I'll probably transfer for my second year so I can take some upper year programs like critical theory at vic, but I want to be able to transfer before Fall 2018 starts.  Does anyone have any experience with this sort of situation? Does anyone have any advice? Who should I contact to discuss options from here on in? How should I contact vic's registrar, and should I even try if it's past the deadline?  Thanks folks.

0.018 |  The professors and administrative staff at this university are honestly so great Just sharing my experiences so far at UofT having (almost) completed third year. It seems like the majority of the professors that I've encountered across a *number* of departments have been so caring, attentive and genuinely interested in helping their students succeed. I've had professors take the time to slot me into their busy schedules when I couldn't make regular office hours, and professors who've taken me or my lab group out for lunch or coffee to get to know us better. Even when talking about non-coursework related topics, I've never felt like any professor was too busy to talk to me.   Even the staff at my registrars' office (Vic) have been incredible. The academic advisors and front desk staff have been so warm and helpful and know exactly how to get you out of a pinch. I can't count the number of times they've bailed me out or helped me plan out my goals when I myself couldn't see where I was headed.  I don't know if it's the good weather or not, but I just felt like sharing some of the positive experiences I've had here. Even though UofT is a tough school, the staff here are super helpful and have made it worthwhile for me.

Along with many other reasons, I would like to transfer to Vic because I agree with their values and I think their Student Union is much more welcoming than the one at St. Mikes.  One of the requirements however is to have at least a 3.3 cGPA, which I don't think I'll be able to reach at the end of the year (maybe at most a 3.0). I was wondering if anyone was able to transfer to Vic or any other college without fully meeting the GPA requirement.  Many thanks!

0.0 |  Quality of life of undergraduates at St. George campus? I was offered admission to Studies in Social Sciences in the Faculty of Arts and Science, St. George campus with membership in Victoria College, earlier today. I wish to study economics and pursue behavioural economics in the future. Im deciding between UofT and UBC to pursue my undergraduate education.  So my question to the subreddit was, how is the quality of life at UoftT like? As in, i've heard from some people that the university is a bit too competitive and ends up becoming a rat race for all 4 years of university. Some also said that the workload is so overbearing that it causes their lively hood to be compromised a considerable amount.  So i'd like to get some insight into what you guys thought about these statements? Can you related to what I've heard? Is the workload at competitiveness really that daunting?

0.083 |  A Guide on Choosing Collages for Prospective CS Students so.. I have said this in some of the posts before, but it seems like a lot of people are still asking this question.   Since you want to do CS, the only building you care about on campus is [this](http://map.utoronto.ca/building/080) You will practically live there   So when you get up in the morning, you want to get to Bahen as soon as possible. So you want to have your college as close to Bahen as possible. Therefore, let me introduce you to a new metric: Minutes to Bahen (MtB).   **Now lets look at the collages:**  * Trinity: Let me throw away this option first. average MtB and you have to wear funny robes on Wednesdays. Also generally a miserable place. If you are not staying in res any college but this will do.  * St. Mikes: Very high MtB (BAD) Have to run across queens park in the morning.  * Victoria: Also bad MtB. Same story as St. Mikes * Woodsworth: Average MtB, around 8. Apartment style res.  * Innis: Around 6 MtB, also apartment style res. * New: Very good MtB. Around 4. Dorm-style. But not very central to the campus. Can not comment on food,  * UC: Also very good MtB! 4 MtB. Also Dorm-style. Food *can* be tasty but not healthy. Also more central to campus than New and less ugly.            
0.017 |  Help deciding on my college rankings Hi all! I'm going to apply to the University of Toronto soon and I'm trying to decide on my college rankings. Here's my deal:  I enjoy partying but don't nesicarily want a "party" culture in my college at UoT. I like the idea of apartment style housing over dorms.

0.016 |  UofT top ranked in Canada for employability (15th in world) UofT sent out an email boasting about the new QS rankings for employability.   Turns out that if you look at the indicators, most of the weight for that ranking comes from *reputation* (30%), and the least weight comes from graduate employment rates (10%). 25% goes to alumni outcomes, which is basically "which universities do the most influential people go to?", which is again a matter of reputation if you think about it.   ...   If you sort by employment rate, UofT is the *second worst* in Canada out of the Universities with a listed employment score (note: this is not the employment rate - the score looks at employment rates 12 months out, and scores them relative to the national employment rate to make comparisons across countries more meaningful):  University of Alberta (91%)  University of Waterloo (87%)  University of British Columbia (86%)  University of Calgary (84%)  Queen's University at Kingston (82%)  McMaster University (73%)  University of Victoria (71%)  University of Toronto (70%)  We literally only beat one other Canadian university:  Universite de Montreal (61%)  Worldwide, our employment rate puts us 148th out of 200 with listed employment rates.   Similarly, if you sort by "Partnerships with employers per faculty" UofT clocks in at 137th in the world.   I'm so glad UofT is proud of these employability rankings that show how effectively the university has prioritized its reputation above everything else. 
0.011 |  Returning for winter term only? To make a long story short I had to leave my first year at UofT after first semester last year for health reasons. I planned on waiting until fall 2018 to return but my health has improved faster than expected and I've recently started thinking about returning this January, just for part time.   Anyone know if this is even possible?   EDIT: so it is possible! anyone have any idea how much it costs for 1 credit? I'm in Vic if that makes a huge difference.

0.0 |  Margaret Addison Internet My room is across the hall from the common room, is the wifi going to be enough? I have a relatively new mac which does not have an ethernet outlet, what should I do if I need to use the ethernet?
0.039 |  Questions about U of T Internet I will be living in Victoria`s Upper Burwash residence.  Is there a limit on the amount of bandwidth that we are allowed to use via ethernet in our rooms? I have heard conflicting information on this. Some people say that there is a limit of 12GB a week, while others say it is unlimited. In addition, is it the same for wireless internet? Is there a separate limit (if any) for wireless, or is it grouped with ethernet? Also, is there a cap on internet speeds, and how is capacity distributed? Is it first come-first serve to access it in each building, or does everyone get a set amount that is capped? I read somewhere that it is capped at 25Mbps. However, I have also heard that there is no cap, and speed is only limited if there are a lot of people using it at a time (so if there are a ton of people using it, it will slow down). If there is no cap, what is the speed on a typical day? Finally, if you are in a double room, is internet slower as compared to a single room? And how does U of T track your internet usage? Does it track you based on the ethernet port that you use in your room, or do you have to sign into or set up something on your computer whenever you need internet access? Thanks in advance.

0.032 |  Vic Meal Plan Got myself Meal Plan A and it comes with $275 Vic Dollars. Can I use these dollars at any cafe on campus? Or just Ned's/Burwash when I finish my meal count? Seems pretty inconvenient to have to go back to my res to get food without using cash...  Also, how heavily does vic enforce their "taking food out of the dining hall" rule, if there is one? 
0.029 |  Victoria College residence question I wouldn't normally ask Reddit about this but due to residence offers for professional faculties being "delayed" this year I received my residence offer today.  I have been given the choice 2 choices as a first year engineering student:  Triple room in Margaret Addison Hall   or   Double room in Rowell Jackman Hall  Any thoughts on what choice I should make? The deadline is Aug 14th so I cannot see them in person. I am wondering if the triple room is cramped or would there be extra room?

0.045 |  How is Vic Freshman Orientation? Our theme ("I am Victoria") was revealed today, and honestly, I think it's pretty pretentious and lame, especially when you put it up against, like, UC's theme (Jurrassic).    I heard that Vic's orientations have a rep for being the best though????  WHAT SHOULD I EXPECT?
0.0 |  Tuition and residence fee deadlines I'm going to be a first year in Arts &amp; Sciences and living at Victoria College. I went ahead and deferred my fees on ACORN because I'll be getting some OSAP money but I couldn't find much information on payment deadlines for those who deferred?  Anyone know the dates for things like minimum payment, full amount due, interest starts accruing, etc. ? For tuition, I was able to find [this](http://www.fees.utoronto.ca/Assets/Student+Accounts+Digital+Assets/2016+2017+Fall+Winter/fac.pdf) "Billing &amp; Payment Schedule" but it's for 2016 - 2017. As for deferred residence fees at Victoria College, I haven't found anything...

0.051 |  Questions on Upper Burwash Residence Hello, Victoria College has recently assigned me to Upper Burwash in a double room. I have a few questions that I would like to ask (sorry, there is a ton of them, and forgive me if any questions seems stupid) :  How does ethernet/wifi access work - is it fast, is there a limit, are there any fees?  What kind of bathrooms are there, and how many people have to share one bathroom? Are there usually wait times to access them? Are the showers in single - occupant bathrooms?  Is there any furniture that we have to bring ourselves and is not provided? Like beds, desks, chairs, etc.?  Are there any free alternatives for doing your laundry? The prices seem a little high, IMO.   Does it get uncomfortably hot/cold in the residence, and is there air conditioning?  Are there any safes to keep your important stuff?  Is there much privacy?  Is there anything else important that I should know?  Thanks in advance for your answers.

0.031 |  please help me pick my first year seminars! hi there!  i'm having a lot of trouble picking 2 first year seminars. i'm planning on taking one in the fall, and one in the spring. i'm hoping to be an english major, and know that getting my breadth requirements for 1, 2, 3 will be pretty easy. however, 4 or 5 are tricky so i want one of the seminars i take this year to fill 4 or 5.  the issue is that i'm having trouble picking which [PMU199](http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/course/fyh-1/2017-18/pmu199h1) seminar to take. i'd love to hear any recommendations! what were your experiences with any PMU199 seminar, did you enjoy it, which professor taught it, etc etc. these are the ones that seem interesting to me: Great Astronomical Issues with Neilson, Video Game Design with Engels, and Life and Death in the Solar System with TBA. has anyone taken these before? has anyone had these professors before? what are they like? is the workload okay? i heard that some PMU199 seminars are hard compared to most seminars. is this true?  none of the LTE199 interest me whatsoever, but again, i'd love to hear any recommendations! does anyone highly recommend a particular [LTE199](http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/course/fyh-1/2017-18/lte199h1) seminar?  and finally, i wanted to take How to Study Everyday Life with Kalmar as my second first year seminar, but it has priority for Vic students until August 4th. do you think there will still be spots open by then? i hear Kalmar is somewhat popular.
