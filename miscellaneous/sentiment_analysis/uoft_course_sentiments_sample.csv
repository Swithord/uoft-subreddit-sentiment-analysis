I apologize for the long post, but I could really use some advice. I have included a short(er) summary of events at the end, but I think it's important to read through the post to really understand my situation.

---

Firstly, let me start off by saying I am Canadian, but I moved around a lot with my family as a teenager, so I've actually studied under a private American and Australian high-school system as well as the Canadian public school system (as I said, it gets complicated).

I was accepted into UTM in 2008 after completing high school in Australia. Admission was based on a number of factors; but perhaps most importantly on my 'ENTER' score of 87.4. This basically means I performed better than 87% of all students who completed Grade 12 in Australia that year.

When I was accepted into the university, my program was supposed to be Computer Science. It turns out that you're apparently required to have Advanced Functions and Calculus &amp; Vectors to be accepted into Comp Sci (not to mention Data Management is highly recommended). Since I came from Australia, Admissions (I guess) didn't really understand my Australian transcript, so I ended up being accepted even though I had never taken the equivalent of Calculus &amp; Vectors etc.

Needless to say, I desperately had to end-up dropping out of both MAT102 and MAT135 in my first year because I was not nearly enough prepared for taking either of those courses; both of which are required for a Comp Sci Major/Specialist.

To complicate matters even further, Admissions gave me a CSC108 equivalency credit for an AP Computer Science course I took in Grade 10 (at the American high-school), and the Registrar instructed me to skip CSC108 and go straight into CSC148. In hindsight, this was a bad decision; I should have at the very least audited the course.

While I managed to pull through with a decent mark (above average), I obviously missed some vital knowledge from CSC108 that wasn't covered in my high-school course and I think really set me back a lot in terms of trying to continue with the program. After completing CSC148 and CSC207, I eventually had to request late withdrawal from CSC209 because I simply wasn't able to keep-up with the course material towards the end and my mark was going downhill.

While I enjoy computer programming and the like, I didn't think Computer Science was the right option for me because it was heavily math based and I was clearly lacking the skills needed to continue in that area. Even if I managed to do all the CSC courses, I would still ultimately have to go back and redo MAT102 + MAT135 to complete the program.

Since then I have not attempted another CSC course. Instead I decided to move into the CCT program. I should mention that in my first year I was also taking CCT100/101 because I had considered at the time that I might want to do a double major with CCT. By the time I reached my second year however, I was learning toward a CCT Digital Enterprise Management specialist.

Also in my first year, I was taking PSY100Y and I enjoyed the course material. For some reason when it came time to select a Subject POSt, I applied for both a CCT DEM Specialist and a Psychology Major. This ended up being fine; I was accepted into both programs.

The problem is that I started to become very unhappy with the CCT program very quickly. I will spare you most of the details, but quite frankly I was really unimpressed by a lot of the course instructors (and the material) in the program. I have taken many courses in all sorts of subject areas, and by far the worse instructors I have encountered are in the CCT program. It wasn’t just the professors either; a lot of the course material (especially related to modern technology) was out-dated and even plain wrong in many instances.

So at this point I was stuck with a CCT specialist and a PSY major, but I kept dropping out of CCT based courses due to an overall poor learning experience (I felt like I wasn’t learning anything). Instead, I kept adding psychology courses and various other electives to fill-up my schedule.

Anyway, ever since I completed my first year, I’ve basically run into this crisis of not having any clue what program I should be working towards with no clear path ahead of me. I kept taking more and more courses in so many different subject areas that I now have credits lined up in departments ranging from Computer Science to Psychology to Astronomy to Forensic Science to Management to Earth Science to Erindale Studies to Geography and even to Classics! Oh, not to mention, of course, I’ve used up all my 100 level credits.

As if this all wasn’t bad enough. After selecting DEM as my specialist, I discovered that in fact the CCT program costs a lot of money. Not only is the tuition extra, but it’s also a flat rate. So when I started working and doing less courses during the term, I found out the university was still charging several thousand dollars for the year. It didn’t matter if I took just one course, the tuition (along with various extra program fees) apparently is locked-in at a flat-rate for CCT students. 

So when I started to run into some financial difficulties at the start of this academic year, I decided I would have to drop the DEM specialist(after I had registered for my courses this term). This was pretty much a no-brainer for me since I didn’t intend on completing the specialist program anyway. After dropping the specialist on ROSI, it instantly reduced my financial account debt by thousand(s) of dollars (even though I was taking the exact same number of courses), so I was very much relieved.

I very quickly discovered however that this was a poor and almost disasterous decision. It turns out that ROSI will only let you register for new courses once you have your Subject POSTs in order (i.e. have 1 specialist or 2 majors or 1 major and 2 minors). Well now I have none of those three, I only have one major in psychology approved. 

This means ROSI will not let me register for ANY new courses, at all.

---

So now I’m stuck in a situation where new subject POSts can’t be added until the end of the academic year. I currently have only 1 Major approved and ROSI will not let me add any new courses until I resolve my subject POSt issue – and I don’t have my courses for next term registered yet. See the problem?

This is not to mention that even if I could immediately be accepted into any Specialist/Major/Minor program I wanted, I wouldn’t know what to select. I figured I would try and get the Department of Psychology to upgrade my Major to a Specialist, but it turns out that even though I’ve taken PSY100 + a couple 2nd year PSY courses AND I’m currently taking PSY201, PSY270, and PSY280… I still don’t qualify for a psychology specialist even once I receive credit for the three PSY courses I’m taking now (the specialist also requires PSY202).

There is a further issue in that my current GPA is currently only 2.9 even though my final marks are always above average (or in some cases just average, but never below). This is partly because I’ve taken a few difficult courses like Astronomy where the class average was a D+. The reason I bring this up is that a psychology specialist also requires a GPA of 3.0 or above which I don’t currently have; but judging by my current performance for this term ending Monday, I'm fairly confident my GPA will rise above 3.0 by next term.

One possible option I have considered is trying to get back into Comp Sci for a minor. If I do that, then I only need 2.5 more credits to complete the minor, however that includes reattempting MAT102 which I also won’t receive any credit for (since I’ve used up my 100 level credits) and doing a math-based computer science course (again, math is really not one of my strong points). If I do that, I’m also stuck with just one minor, and I honestly can’t come up with another minor that I have some credits in to satisfy the university requirements (for example CCT doesn’t have a minor program option).

----

TL;DR:  I'm Canadian, I did high-school under the US &amp; Aussie system. I got accepted into UTM in the Comp Sci program, but I lack the math skills needed to complete the program. I was also given an equivalency credit for the first year comp sci course so I skipped to CSC148 and as a result I missed out on a vital learning experience that set me behind when attempting higher level CSC courses.

I quickly realized I wasn’t set out to do Comp Sci as a major/specialist (considering the math involved) and I started moving toward the CCT program and applied for a DEM specialist and did some CCT + Management courses. I also got approved for a psychology major at the same time.

Long story short, I really did not like the CCT program (and I ended up dropping many CCT courses I was registered in). At some point I started taking several elective courses in a bunch of different departments instead of CCT courses and I eventually dropped the DEM specialist from ROSI this year (to save money primarily as the CCT program costs a lot extra). 

This resulted in ROSI preventing me from registering for any new courses for next semester (until I resolve my Subject  POSt issues). Now I’m stuck having just a psychology major approved and I don’t meet the requirements for a psychology specialist (not to mention the program has limited enrollment).

The credits I do have are so spread out across different subject areas that they really don’t help me toward any particular program requirements. I’ve been studying at UofT since 2008 (4 years) and I estimate that in the best case scenario I may be able to graduate in 3 years.

While I managed to pull through with a decent mark (above average), I obviously missed some vital knowledge from CSC108 that wasn't covered in my high-school course and I think really set me back a lot in terms of trying to continue with the program. After completing CSC148 and CSC207, I eventually had to request late withdrawal from CSC209 because I simply wasn't able to keep-up with the course material towards the end and my mark was going downhill.

While I enjoy computer programming and the like, I didn't think Computer Science was the right option for me because it was heavily math based and I was clearly lacking the skills needed to continue in that area. Even if I managed to do all the CSC courses, I would still ultimately have to go back and redo MAT102 + MAT135 to complete the program.

Since then I have not attempted another CSC course. Instead I decided to move into the CCT program. I should mention that in my first year I was also taking CCT100/101 because I had considered at the time that I might want to do a double major with CCT. By the time I reached my second year however, I was learning toward a CCT Digital Enterprise Management specialist.

Also in my first year, I was taking PSY100Y and I enjoyed the course material. For some reason when it came time to select a Subject POSt, I applied for both a CCT DEM Specialist and a Psychology Major. This ended up being fine; I was accepted into both programs.

The problem is that I started to become very unhappy with the CCT program very quickly. I will spare you most of the details, but quite frankly I was really unimpressed by a lot of the course instructors (and the material) in the program. I have taken many courses in all sorts of subject areas, and by far the worse instructors I have encountered are in the CCT program. It wasn’t just the professors either; a lot of the course material (especially related to modern technology) was out-dated and even plain wrong in many instances.

So at this point I was stuck with a CCT specialist and a PSY major, but I kept dropping out of CCT based courses due to an overall poor learning experience (I felt like I wasn’t learning anything). Instead, I kept adding psychology courses and various other electives to fill-up my schedule.

Anyway, ever since I completed my first year, I’ve basically run into this crisis of not having any clue what program I should be working towards with no clear path ahead of me. I kept taking more and more courses in so many different subject areas that I now have credits lined up in departments ranging from Computer Science to Psychology to Astronomy to Forensic Science to Management to Earth Science to Erindale Studies to Geography and even to Classics! Oh, not to mention, of course, I’ve used up all my 100 level credits.

As if this all wasn’t bad enough. After selecting DEM as my specialist, I discovered that in fact the CCT program costs a lot of money. Not only is the tuition extra, but it’s also a flat rate. So when I started working and doing less courses during the term, I found out the university was still charging several thousand dollars for the year. It didn’t matter if I took just one course, the tuition (along with various extra program fees) apparently is locked-in at a flat-rate for CCT students. 

So when I started to run into some financial difficulties at the start of this academic year, I decided I would have to drop the DEM specialist(after I had registered for my courses this term). This was pretty much a no-brainer for me since I didn’t intend on completing the specialist program anyway. After dropping the specialist on ROSI, it instantly reduced my financial account debt by thousand(s) of dollars (even though I was taking the exact same number of courses), so I was very much relieved.

I very quickly discovered however that this was a poor and almost disasterous decision. It turns out that ROSI will only let you register for new courses once you have your Subject POSTs in order (i.e. have 1 specialist or 2 majors or 1 major and 2 minors). Well now I have none of those three, I only have one major in psychology approved. 

This means ROSI will not let me register for ANY new courses, at all.

---

So now I’m stuck in a situation where new subject POSts can’t be added until the end of the academic year. I currently have only 1 Major approved and ROSI will not let me add any new courses until I resolve my subject POSt issue – and I don’t have my courses for next term registered yet. See the problem?

This is not to mention that even if I could immediately be accepted into any Specialist/Major/Minor program I wanted, I wouldn’t know what to select. I figured I would try and get the Department of Psychology to upgrade my Major to a Specialist, but it turns out that even though I’ve taken PSY100 + a couple 2nd year PSY courses AND I’m currently taking PSY201, PSY270, and PSY280… I still don’t qualify for a psychology specialist even once I receive credit for the three PSY courses I’m taking now (the specialist also requires PSY202).

There is a further issue in that my current GPA is currently only 2.9 even though my final marks are always above average (or in some cases just average, but never below). This is partly because I’ve taken a few difficult courses like Astronomy where the class average was a D+. The reason I bring this up is that a psychology specialist also requires a GPA of 3.0 or above which I don’t currently have; but judging by my current performance for this term ending Monday, I'm fairly confident my GPA will rise above 3.0 by next term.

One possible option I have considered is trying to get back into Comp Sci for a minor. If I do that, then I only need 2.5 more credits to complete the minor, however that includes reattempting MAT102 which I also won’t receive any credit for (since I’ve used up my 100 level credits) and doing a math-based computer science course (again, math is really not one of my strong points). If I do that, I’m also stuck with just one minor, and I honestly can’t come up with another minor that I have some credits in to satisfy the university requirements (for example CCT doesn’t have a minor program option).

----

TL;DR:  I'm Canadian, I did high-school under the US &amp; Aussie system. I got accepted into UTM in the Comp Sci program, but I lack the math skills needed to complete the program. I was also given an equivalency credit for the first year comp sci course so I skipped to CSC148 and as a result I missed out on a vital learning experience that set me behind when attempting higher level CSC courses.

I quickly realized I wasn’t set out to do Comp Sci as a major/specialist (considering the math involved) and I started moving toward the CCT program and applied for a DEM specialist and did some CCT + Management courses. I also got approved for a psychology major at the same time.

Long story short, I really did not like the CCT program (and I ended up dropping many CCT courses I was registered in). At some point I started taking several elective courses in a bunch of different departments instead of CCT courses and I eventually dropped the DEM specialist from ROSI this year (to save money primarily as the CCT program costs a lot extra). 

This resulted in ROSI preventing me from registering for any new courses for next semester (until I resolve my Subject  POSt issues). Now I’m stuck having just a psychology major approved and I don’t meet the requirements for a psychology specialist (not to mention the program has limited enrollment).

The credits I do have are so spread out across different subject areas that they really don’t help me toward any particular program requirements. I’ve been studying at UofT since 2008 (4 years) and I estimate that in the best case scenario I may be able to graduate in 3 years.

---

Firstly, let me start off by saying I am Canadian, but I moved around a lot with my family as a teenager, so I've actually studied under a private American and Australian high-school system as well as the Canadian public school system (as I said, it gets complicated).

I was accepted into UTM in 2008 after completing high school in Australia. Admission was based on a number of factors; but perhaps most importantly on my 'ENTER' score of 87.4. This basically means I performed better than 87% of all students who completed Grade 12 in Australia that year.

When I was accepted into the university, my program was supposed to be Computer Science. It turns out that you're apparently required to have Advanced Functions and Calculus &amp; Vectors to be accepted into Comp Sci (not to mention Data Management is highly recommended). Since I came from Australia, Admissions (I guess) didn't really understand my Australian transcript, so I ended up being accepted even though I had never taken the equivalent of Calculus &amp; Vectors etc.

Needless to say, I desperately had to end-up dropping out of both MAT102 and MAT135 in my first year because I was not nearly enough prepared for taking either of those courses; both of which are required for a Comp Sci Major/Specialist.

To complicate matters even further, Admissions gave me a CSC108 equivalency credit for an AP Computer Science course I took in Grade 10 (at the American high-school), and the Registrar instructed me to skip CSC108 and go straight into CSC148.

I currently have only 1 Major approved and ROSI will not let me add any new courses until I resolve my subject POSt issue – and I don’t have my courses for next term registered yet. See the problem?

This is not to mention that even if I could immediately be accepted into any Specialist/Major/Minor program I wanted, I wouldn’t know what to select. I figured I would try and get the Department of Psychology to upgrade my Major to a Specialist, but it turns out that even though I’ve taken PSY100 + a couple 2nd year PSY courses AND I’m currently taking PSY201, PSY270, and PSY280… I still don’t qualify for a psychology specialist even once I receive credit for the three PSY courses I’m taking now (the specialist also requires PSY202).

There is a further issue in that my current GPA is currently only 2.9 even though my final marks are always above average (or in some cases just average, but never below). This is partly because I’ve taken a few difficult courses like Astronomy where the class average was a D+. The reason I bring this up is that a psychology specialist also requires a GPA of 3.0 or above which I don’t currently have; but judging by my current performance for this term ending Monday, I'm fairly confident my GPA will rise above 3.0 by next term.

One possible option I have considered is trying to get back into Comp Sci for a minor. If I do that, then I only need 2.5 more credits to complete the minor, however that includes reattempting MAT102 which I also won’t receive any credit for (since I’ve used up my 100 level credits) and doing a math-based computer science course (again, math is really not one of my strong points). If I do that, I’m also stuck with just one minor, and I honestly can’t come up with another minor that I have some credits in to satisfy the university requirements (for example CCT doesn’t have a minor program option).

----

TL;DR:  I'm Canadian, I did high-school under the US &amp; Aussie system. I got accepted into UTM in the Comp Sci program, but I lack the math skills needed to complete the program. I was also given an equivalency credit for the first year comp sci course so I skipped to CSC148 and as a result I missed out on a vital learning experience that set me behind when attempting higher level CSC courses.

I quickly realized I wasn’t set out to do Comp Sci as a major/specialist (considering the math involved) and I started moving toward the CCT program and applied for a DEM specialist and did some CCT + Management courses. I also got approved for a psychology major at the same time.

Long story short, I really did not like the CCT program (and I ended up dropping many CCT courses I was registered in). At some point I started taking several elective courses in a bunch of different departments instead of CCT courses and I eventually dropped the DEM specialist from ROSI this year (to save money primarily as the CCT program costs a lot extra). 

This resulted in ROSI preventing me from registering for any new courses for next semester (until I resolve my Subject  POSt issues). Now I’m stuck having just a psychology major approved and I don’t meet the requirements for a psychology specialist (not to mention the program has limited enrollment).

The credits I do have are so spread out across different subject areas that they really don’t help me toward any particular program requirements. I’ve been studying at UofT since 2008 (4 years) and I estimate that in the best case scenario I may be able to graduate in 3 years.

I apologize for the long post, but I could really use some advice. I have included a short(er) summary of events at the end, but I think it's important to read through the post to really understand my situation.

---

Firstly, let me start off by saying I am Canadian, but I moved around a lot with my family as a teenager, so I've actually studied under a private American and Australian high-school system as well as the Canadian public school system (as I said, it gets complicated).

I was accepted into UTM in 2008 after completing high school in Australia. Admission was based on a number of factors; but perhaps most importantly on my 'ENTER' score of 87.4. This basically means I performed better than 87% of all students who completed Grade 12 in Australia that year.

When I was accepted into the university, my program was supposed to be Computer Science. It turns out that you're apparently required to have Advanced Functions and Calculus &amp; Vectors to be accepted into Comp Sci (not to mention Data Management is highly recommended). Since I came from Australia, Admissions (I guess) didn't really understand my Australian transcript, so I ended up being accepted even though I had never taken the equivalent of Calculus &amp; Vectors etc.

Needless to say, I desperately had to end-up dropping out of both MAT102 and MAT135 in my first year because I was not nearly enough prepared for taking either of those courses; both of which are required for a Comp Sci Major/Specialist.

To complicate matters even further, Admissions gave me a CSC108 equivalency credit for an AP Computer Science course I took in Grade 10 (at the American high-school), and the Registrar instructed me to skip CSC108 and go straight into CSC148. In hindsight, this was a bad decision; I should have at the very least audited the course.

While I managed to pull through with a decent mark (above average), I obviously missed some vital knowledge from CSC108 that wasn't covered in my high-school course and I think really set me back a lot in terms of trying to continue with the program. After completing CSC148 and CSC207, I eventually had to request late withdrawal from CSC209 because I simply wasn't able to keep-up with the course material towards the end and my mark was going downhill.

While I enjoy computer programming and the like, I didn't think Computer Science was the right option for me because it was heavily math based and I was clearly lacking the skills needed to continue in that area. Even if I managed to do all the CSC courses, I would still ultimately have to go back and redo MAT102 + MAT135 to complete the program.

Since then I have not attempted another CSC course. Instead I decided to move into the CCT program. I should mention that in my first year I was also taking CCT100/101 because I had considered at the time that I might want to do a double major with CCT. By the time I reached my second year however, I was learning toward a CCT Digital Enterprise Management specialist.

Also in my first year, I was taking PSY100Y and I enjoyed the course material. For some reason when it came time to select a Subject POSt, I applied for both a CCT DEM Specialist and a Psychology Major. This ended up being fine; I was accepted into both programs.

The problem is that I started to become very unhappy with the CCT program very quickly. I will spare you most of the details, but quite frankly I was really unimpressed by a lot of the course instructors (and the material) in the program. I have taken many courses in all sorts of subject areas, and by far the worse instructors I have encountered are in the CCT program. It wasn’t just the professors either; a lot of the course material (especially related to modern technology) was out-dated and even plain wrong in many instances.

So at this point I was stuck with a CCT specialist and a PSY major, but I kept dropping out of CCT based courses due to an overall poor learning experience (I felt like I wasn’t learning anything). Instead, I kept adding psychology courses and various other electives to fill-up my schedule.

Anyway, ever since I completed my first year, I’ve basically run into this crisis of not having any clue what program I should be working towards with no clear path ahead of me. I kept taking more and more courses in so many different subject areas that I now have credits lined up in departments ranging from Computer Science to Psychology to Astronomy to Forensic Science to Management to Earth Science to Erindale Studies to Geography and even to Classics! Oh, not to mention, of course, I’ve used up all my 100 level credits.

As if this all wasn’t bad enough. After selecting DEM as my specialist, I discovered that in fact the CCT program costs a lot of money. Not only is the tuition extra, but it’s also a flat rate. So when I started working and doing less courses during the term, I found out the university was still charging several thousand dollars for the year. It didn’t matter if I took just one course, the tuition (along with various extra program fees) apparently is locked-in at a flat-rate for CCT students. 

So when I started to run into some financial difficulties at the start of this academic year, I decided I would have to drop the DEM specialist(after I had registered for my courses this term). This was pretty much a no-brainer for me since I didn’t intend on completing the specialist program anyway. After dropping the specialist on ROSI, it instantly reduced my financial account debt by thousand(s) of dollars (even though I was taking the exact same number of courses), so I was very much relieved.

I very quickly discovered however that this was a poor and almost disasterous decision. It turns out that ROSI will only let you register for new courses once you have your Subject POSTs in order (i.e. have 1 specialist or 2 majors or 1 major and 2 minors). Well now I have none of those three, I only have one major in psychology approved. 

This means ROSI will not let me register for ANY new courses, at all.

I was accepted into UTM in 2008 after completing high school in Australia. Admission was based on a number of factors; but perhaps most importantly on my 'ENTER' score of 87.4. This basically means I performed better than 87% of all students who completed Grade 12 in Australia that year.

When I was accepted into the university, my program was supposed to be Computer Science. It turns out that you're apparently required to have Advanced Functions and Calculus &amp; Vectors to be accepted into Comp Sci (not to mention Data Management is highly recommended). Since I came from Australia, Admissions (I guess) didn't really understand my Australian transcript, so I ended up being accepted even though I had never taken the equivalent of Calculus &amp; Vectors etc.

Needless to say, I desperately had to end-up dropping out of both MAT102 and MAT135 in my first year because I was not nearly enough prepared for taking either of those courses; both of which are required for a Comp Sci Major/Specialist.

To complicate matters even further, Admissions gave me a CSC108 equivalency credit for an AP Computer Science course I took in Grade 10 (at the American high-school), and the Registrar instructed me to skip CSC108 and go straight into CSC148. In hindsight, this was a bad decision; I should have at the very least audited the course.

While I managed to pull through with a decent mark (above average), I obviously missed some vital knowledge from CSC108 that wasn't covered in my high-school course and I think really set me back a lot in terms of trying to continue with the program. After completing CSC148 and CSC207, I eventually had to request late withdrawal from CSC209 because I simply wasn't able to keep-up with the course material towards the end and my mark was going downhill.

While I enjoy computer programming and the like, I didn't think Computer Science was the right option for me because it was heavily math based and I was clearly lacking the skills needed to continue in that area. Even if I managed to do all the CSC courses, I would still ultimately have to go back and redo MAT102 + MAT135 to complete the program.

Since then I have not attempted another CSC course. Instead I decided to move into the CCT program. I should mention that in my first year I was also taking CCT100/101 because I had considered at the time that I might want to do a double major with CCT. By the time I reached my second year however, I was learning toward a CCT Digital Enterprise Management specialist.

Also in my first year, I was taking PSY100Y and I enjoyed the course material. For some reason when it came time to select a Subject POSt, I applied for both a CCT DEM Specialist and a Psychology Major. This ended up being fine; I was accepted into both programs.

The problem is that I started to become very unhappy with the CCT program very quickly. I will spare you most of the details, but quite frankly I was really unimpressed by a lot of the course instructors (and the material) in the program. I have taken many courses in all sorts of subject areas, and by far the worse instructors I have encountered are in the CCT program. It wasn’t just the professors either; a lot of the course material (especially related to modern technology) was out-dated and even plain wrong in many instances.

So at this point I was stuck with a CCT specialist and a PSY major, but I kept dropping out of CCT based courses due to an overall poor learning experience (I felt like I wasn’t learning anything). Instead, I kept adding psychology courses and various other electives to fill-up my schedule.

Anyway, ever since I completed my first year, I’ve basically run into this crisis of not having any clue what program I should be working towards with no clear path ahead of me. I kept taking more and more courses in so many different subject areas that I now have credits lined up in departments ranging from Computer Science to Psychology to Astronomy to Forensic Science to Management to Earth Science to Erindale Studies to Geography and even to Classics! Oh, not to mention, of course, I’ve used up all my 100 level credits.

As if this all wasn’t bad enough. After selecting DEM as my specialist, I discovered that in fact the CCT program costs a lot of money. Not only is the tuition extra, but it’s also a flat rate. So when I started working and doing less courses during the term, I found out the university was still charging several thousand dollars for the year. It didn’t matter if I took just one course, the tuition (along with various extra program fees) apparently is locked-in at a flat-rate for CCT students. 

So when I started to run into some financial difficulties at the start of this academic year, I decided I would have to drop the DEM specialist(after I had registered for my courses this term). This was pretty much a no-brainer for me since I didn’t intend on completing the specialist program anyway. After dropping the specialist on ROSI, it instantly reduced my financial account debt by thousand(s) of dollars (even though I was taking the exact same number of courses), so I was very much relieved.

I very quickly discovered however that this was a poor and almost disasterous decision. It turns out that ROSI will only let you register for new courses once you have your Subject POSTs in order (i.e. have 1 specialist or 2 majors or 1 major and 2 minors). Well now I have none of those three, I only have one major in psychology approved. 

This means ROSI will not let me register for ANY new courses, at all.

---

So now I’m stuck in a situation where new subject POSts can’t be added until the end of the academic year. I currently have only 1 Major approved and ROSI will not let me add any new courses until I resolve my subject POSt issue – and I don’t have my courses for next term registered yet. See the problem?

This is not to mention that even if I could immediately be accepted into any Specialist/Major/Minor program I wanted, I wouldn’t know what to select. I figured I would try and get the Department of Psychology to upgrade my Major to a Specialist, but it turns out that even though I’ve taken PSY100 + a couple 2nd year PSY courses AND I’m currently taking PSY201, PSY270, and PSY280… I still don’t qualify for a psychology specialist even once I receive credit for the three PSY courses I’m taking now (the specialist also requires PSY202).

There is a further issue in that my current GPA is currently only 2.9 even though my final marks are always above average (or in some cases just average, but never below). This is partly because I’ve taken a few difficult courses like Astronomy where the class average was a D+. The reason I bring this up is that a psychology specialist also requires a GPA of 3.0 or above which I don’t currently have; but judging by my current performance for this term ending Monday, I'm fairly confident my GPA will rise above 3.0 by next term.

One possible option I have considered is trying to get back into Comp Sci for a minor. If I do that, then I only need 2.5 more credits to complete the minor, however that includes reattempting MAT102 which I also won’t receive any credit for (since I’ve used up my 100 level credits) and doing a math-based computer science course (again, math is really not one of my strong points). If I do that, I’m also stuck with just one minor, and I honestly can’t come up with another minor that I have some credits in to satisfy the university requirements (for example CCT doesn’t have a minor program option).

----

TL;DR:  I'm Canadian, I did high-school under the US &amp; Aussie system. I got accepted into UTM in the Comp Sci program, but I lack the math skills needed to complete the program. I was also given an equivalency credit for the first year comp sci course so I skipped to CSC148 and as a result I missed out on a vital learning experience that set me behind when attempting higher level CSC courses.

I quickly realized I wasn’t set out to do Comp Sci as a major/specialist (considering the math involved) and I started moving toward the CCT program and applied for a DEM specialist and did some CCT + Management courses. I also got approved for a psychology major at the same time.

Long story short, I really did not like the CCT program (and I ended up dropping many CCT courses I was registered in). At some point I started taking several elective courses in a bunch of different departments instead of CCT courses and I eventually dropped the DEM specialist from ROSI this year (to save money primarily as the CCT program costs a lot extra). 

This resulted in ROSI preventing me from registering for any new courses for next semester (until I resolve my Subject  POSt issues). Now I’m stuck having just a psychology major approved and I don’t meet the requirements for a psychology specialist (not to mention the program has limited enrollment).

The credits I do have are so spread out across different subject areas that they really don’t help me toward any particular program requirements. I’ve been studying at UofT since 2008 (4 years) and I estimate that in the best case scenario I may be able to graduate in 3 years.

19,20,2012,"I'm a U of T grad student, TA, and course instructor, and I'm on strike.  Hi U of T redditors. In a few hours (barring an alien invasion that distracts us all) CUPE 3902 Unit 1, which represents graduate teaching assistants and instructors, will go on strike. I thought I'd post here to try to explain why. I've got a pretty good background to understand this: I went to U of T for my undergrad (0T6 in social and economic geography), went to an American university (Ohio State) for my masters, where I worked as a non-unionized TA. Now I'm back as a PhD student in the geography department, where I've worked as both a TA I've spent this semester as a course instructor (any GGR221 students here? I miss you already). I honestly don't know any more than what's been publicly stated by the Union or the University, but I figure I've likely been more paying attention to this than other people, so I'll try to tell you what I know.  

First things first: what does a strike mean for undergrads? Most classes with more than 30 students have at least one TA who helps with the grading and course administration. Despite what you might think, grading takes a lot of time and effort and it's not feasible for professors to do it themselves if the class is more than a few dozen students. During the strike, it is likely that a lot of material won't be graded. The union and the U of T faculty association have asked professors not to change their course content to avoid grading because (1) that's a form of scabbing and (2) it hurts the learning experience. For classes with labs or demonstrations run by TAs, it's likely these will be cancelled. Each department and individual professor will try to make the necessary accommodations. Courses taught by a PhD student (like mine) will either be cancelled or the teacher will be replaced.  

Keep in mind that if you don't want to cross the picket lines, university regulations clearly state that you can't be punished or penalized for this. 

What's the strike about? It's not actually about pay. The the contract that was presented to the union and rejected by the members, the wage increases were just a bit lower than we requested, though what we requested and what was offered were both under the cost of living increases in Toronto. 

The strike is fundamentally about the number of hours grad students need to TA. There are two sides to this: (1) the size of tutorials and (2) the amount of TA hours a grad student needs to work as part of their funding package.

Let's look at the size of tutorials first.  I'm teaching a class this semester. It's soc-sci class that's popular with engineers and life-science students because's it's fun, interesting and useful. It's also writing intensive, which a lot of the people coming from outside the social sciences aren't used to. (please note: New Economies Spaces is totally the best class and you should all take it.) A few weeks ago, I gave the first writing assignment and I got a lot of messages from students asking for help on how to write an essay. It's very hard if all you're used to are lab reports.

In the past, this class has had reasonably sized tutorials, 20-30 students each. This gives the TAs a chance to work with the students and help them learn how to structure essays. In previous years, the TAs have worked with the WIT program to learn how to help students who's first language isn't English. As the person who has to read 80 final essays, I can tell you this made a big difference, 
This year, the tutorial size is 100 students. That's not a tutorial, that's a large lecture. It's not possible to teach writing skills in a class that size. So, the papers are worse and the students get worse grades. They also learn less and perpetuate the most common complaint that employers have about STEM grads: they they have poor communication skills. 

One of the main points of contention is the size of tutorials. The union wants a hard cap on tutorial sizes, limiting the use of these giant tutorials. The university countered with a plan for a working group to investigate what a tutorial is. I kid you not, they have offered us a working group that will meet a maximum 3 times, to define what a tutorial is.

What the union is fighting for is smaller tutorials. This helps undergrads learn better. U of T can't exactly be called a cozy place for early-year students. You're not just a number, you're a number that's actively disliked by the faculty and administration. Tutorials are one of the few points of personal contact between students in large classes and people who can help them. Classes are only getting bigger, there are plenty of third year classes with more than 150 people in them. We need small tutorials to ensure that students get the chance to ask questions, get guidance, and actually interact with their fellow students in a way that isn't possible in a 500-person lecture. 

Now, I'm not going to say this is altruistic. Smaller tutorials mean more TA hours are available, which helps us achieve our goal of providing more grad students with the opportunity to TA. This is really important for upper year graduate students (masters students in their 2nd year and PhDs beyond their 4th or 5th year), who no longer get their tuition covered as part of their funding package. I'm facing this prospect next year. TA hours help these students pay the bills and help them graduate. 

The second point is related to this. The university has been steadily increasing the amount of TA hours grads must work in order to get their funding package. This is really complicated and I don't understand it myself, but essentially every graduate student is guaranteed funding — tuition plus about $15,000 — as part of being accepted at U of T. This is a fantastic idea, far too many universities let in too many grad students who just can't hack it, only to saddle them with debt and overwhelm the job market. However, the university has been increasing the number of TA hours a grad student needs to work to get this $15,000. They've essentially reduced the number of research grants given out and increased the amount of time you need to spend TAing. Basically, this means that we have less time for our own research, forcing us to take longer to complete our degrees. What we're asking is for the university to draw more of their TAs from what's known as the ""unfunded cohort"" (those students beyond their 2nd or 5th year for Masters and PhDs respectively). 

Look, I don't envy the choices the university has to make. I have several high level administrators on my dissertation committee and I know that their struggling with how to pay for the multiple demands placed on them. However, it's clear that the university just wouldn't function without TAs and course instructors. We're not asking for a lot of money. I just did my taxes today. Last year I made 11,624.72 as a TA. If we get everything we want out of the university, that will go up a whopping 2% next year. No one is here for the money, we're here for the love of the game. All we're asking for are slightly better working conditions and a bit better recognition of our work. Our demands on the university were very modest, and they answered with a working group to study the issue that the working group set up by the last contract didn't manage to.  

I'll try to hang out here and answer what questions I can. I'm leaving tomorrow for a conference, but hopefully I can help people out. If not, you'll find me on the picket line and we can rap about economic geography. 

**tl;dr I'm on strike for smaller tutorials and more TAs. Please support us!**",GGR221,0.3940902054309845,0.2991333901882171

I got an 85 in CSC108 and a 91 in CSC148, did all my assignments alone. I know grades aren't the end-all-be-all, but I'm hoping that it'll be better than randomly pairing up with people.



I'm basically looking for people who also got A's in their computer science courses.

Bonus points:

-Upper year in math/physics/CS, or took CSC150/240

-Working at BA/MP/AB this summer as a research student (I'm working at MP this summer and it'd make meeting up very simple)



I know this may come off as elitist or something, but whatever... I just want a good mark and a good learning experience with software design in teams.",CSC207,0.9457135796546936,0.0089245829731225

I'm going into CS next year, and my options for math are 135&amp;136 or 137. I'm also planning on taking the rotman pre-reqs to try to transfer into that program in the second year.

I did Math SL IB, and I heard that those students should do 137 instead of 135&amp;136. However, the pre-reqs for Rotman are either 133 or 135/136. 

Will Rotman not consider me if I took 137 instead of 135/136?

I'm going into my first year at St. George (Vic College), and thinking of majoring in Economics or International Relations, or even both. And I have a few questions about what courses I should take - 

Seminars - Are they actually helpful, and worth it? I gather theres a course requirement for seminars, but they don't contribute to my major, but I still get credit for it? Its all a bit confusing.

Math - I did IB SL Math, and got predicted a 7 in it and I think i'm fairly strong in it. But i'm wondering if i should do MAT133, MAT135+136, or MAT137. 

Transfer Credit - I did HL Bio, Chem, and Psych and get transfer credits for all of them. Will they satisfy my breadth requirements for Groups 4 and 5 (Bio is 4, Chem is 5), or do i have to do it at university?

Other Courses - I'm planning on taking ECO100Y1, HIS103, and maybe PHL100. Do you have any recommendations? Things I should add, change, or drop?

Also, I don't want to take any electives before my last year in case anything (see this) goes wrong with compulsories before then, as electives can be bumped/dropped but compulsories can't.

Is anyone else in the same boat? I find it idiotic that the class has only ONE lecture section with 150 spots, and there are already 95 students on the waitlist as of this post (I'm 49th). At the same time, looking at MAT223H1F, I'm seeing Full (no waitlist)/66 spaces/117 spaces/117 spaces for the four lecture sections respectively--as an introductory second-year stats course, are none of these Linear Algebra profs competent enough to teach it instead of an empty course?

So, what are my options? I'm already planning to talk to the registrars both at my college and the faculty, the head of the computer science department, the head of the statistics department, and if necessary the dean and other members of the university's administration. Any other ideas?",CSC263,0.1554916054010391,0.3437205851078033

There's no way I would take MAT157 or any upper year equivalents, and even MAT137 scares me a little (but if I worked really hard I think I could do okay in it). Is that reason enough for me to steer clear of the Faculty of Economics programs because they're definitely much more math intensive?
 
That all being said, what do you think makes me the most job marketable or does it not matter? I see myself going back to grad school to get my masters later (maybe in Econ, maybe MBA), but I want to spend some time working first. I am interested in investment banking, financial analysis, or really anything else in the financial sector. My qualm with Rotman is that I'd basically take my first year math, and then I wouldn't get the chance to take another math course. My problem with either of the Faculty of Economics programs is that I'm not allowed to take upper-year RSM courses (like Investments, Capital Market Theory, Risk Management, etc.), which I think would be very good preparation for the financial sector.
 
I guess my end goal is just employability in the general area iBanking and finance, and do you think one of those POSts would make me more employable or marketable than any of the others?

Here's the problem: I'm a first year student, though I will be taking a second year history course. The only issue, is that I have 3 different ones to choose from.

Right now, I'm signed up for HIS220 (Medieval history). I've heard mixed reviews about the class and professors, and it only has a 67% retake rate on the anti-calendar. 

I am also on the wait list (16th in line) for HIS243 (Europe from 1450-1648), and am already in HIS244 (Europe from 1648-1815). It is very likely that I'll get in to HIS243, seeing as I was 25th on the waitlist on Thursday, and have already moved 9 places. Both of these courses had 91% of the responses saying they would retake the course on the anti-calendar. 

Lastly, there is HIS263 (Canadian history) which has ample room. I believe it's percentage was 77, and this course would also fulfill the credit I need for the History of the Americas requirement in a history major. 

So, which course should I take? It would be taken concurrently with HIS109 by the way (1350-1945), and I honestly don't know what to do.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

179,189,2013,"Pass/Fail Credit -- Skip Exam I'm wondering if anyone has had experience with Pass/Fail credits.

I'm taking ENG250 as part of the breadth requirement. I'm in 4th year and am averaging a high 70. I made the course pass/fail because I wasn't sure how well I'd do and I didn't want to risk lowering my GPA.

The final exam is worth 30%, meaning I'm going in with a final mark of 50-something. I've already ""passed"" the course and, if I am able, would rather just not write the exam and focus on other courses.

Anyone have experience doing something like this? What was the outcome? How did you ensure you would receive the ""pass""? I want to talk to the professor and let him know my plan of action and ""guarantee"" my pass in the course...

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",ENG250,0.0126787591725587,0.9040541052818298

Today I realized that I just made a pretty important decision with very little supporting information. So I decided to turn to the community to ask for either help on my specific example or some techniques about finding more information about specific programs.

I was deciding between biotechnology and neuroscience for my human biology major. In the end I went with biotech because as I understand it overs a broader area encompassing scientific and business elements. Also I worked in a research lab past summer and found it to be boring with low pay and not an extraordinary amount of brain work. Hopefully after undergrad with a biotech background I will have the option of getting more into the business aspect with a scientific angle. What I am asking specifically: How hard is this program? How interested are the people in it that are doing it? What is your after undergrad destination with this major?

My other major is cognitive science. I heard that cog250 is one of the most rewarding most interesting courses at UofT so this program is mostly for personal interest. How hard is this major and what are your thoughts on the field in general?

thank you in advance for reply and guidance. Good luck on finals!",COG250,0.9540023803710938,0.0041412566788494

So I'm a UTM transfer student from uOttawa (effective Fall 2013), and I realized that I want to study life sciences (I'm a social science student, who wants to add a biology major to his degree). 

Next summer (2014), I would like to take CHM110H5+120H5 and MAT134Y5 throughout the whole summer. I would take it this coming fall, but MAT134Y5 is a Corequsite for CHM110/120, and MAT is restricted to Life Science students. Basically, I'm trying to add a Bio major, and I will be taking the intro BIO courses this fall(2013), and then do calculus and chem in the summer (2014) so that I can continue on into the program. 

Is this a terrible idea? I am pretty good at chemistry, and I was ok in math during high school. I also figured if I could spend the year self studying these two subjects then I would be ok. I think my biggest fear is that the amount of hours of school. Sometimes I think I can handle it, sometimes I get scared.

Can someone offer suggestions, warnings? Should I get a tutor, or should I give up??

I don't know why, but I originally saw CHM151 as the *only* 1st year chemistry course. Looking at the timetables it is not possible for me to take both CHM151 and EAS100^(Chinese) at the same time.

A friend^(3rd year?) was also looking through the calendar and saw these two courses (CHM138,CHM139), and said it might be easier if I took those instead of the full CHM151, which would then make room for me to take EAS100.

For the MAT courses, the same friend said I should take (MAT135,MAT136) instead because they were mostly calculations while MAT137 was more theory. I have a feeling the only upside to MAT137 is that I get to buy his old textbook.

* **HIS241** Europe in the 19th Century, 1815-1914 with Dimitriadis - great prof, really knowledgable, funny and approachable. Was very clear in what he wanted from us and there was nothing unpredictable in his exams. I didn't like how he only had a sheet of terms for each class, because he didn't touch on some of them and would jump around a lot.


* **HIS242** Europe in the 20th Century with Jenkins - I've heard a lot of mixed reviews about her, many people like her on ratemyprof but personally I wasn't a fan. The material was all very interesting though, and I liked the sourcebook as part of the readings.


* **HIS244** Early Modern Europe, 1648-1815 with Stiles - talks very fast, not all information is available on the slides. I like how he tried to incorporate jokes/songs/fun facts into his classes, but wasn't very open to changing a mark after a lot of appealing. Many many people appealed to get their essays remarked, and there was a lot of hate towards some of the TAs. My TA was great though, he encouraged me to appeal and was one of the best TAs that I've had at UofT.

* **HIS251** East Central Europe with Wrobel - the material is super interesting, and the prof is great, he's so enthusiastic and such a nice man, but it's a difficult course because it covers so many years in history in such a large area of Europe. I would take it again if it was the only class I was taking...but I just couldn't handle it so maybe it's only me.

* **HIS385** History of Hong Kong with Lim - Lectures were a little dry, but he was very clear, lecture slides very detailed, a great prof, would take this class again and would recommend this class. There isn't too much to remember because the course only covers about 100 years of history, and personally I find Hong Kong very interesting!

* **EAS103** Premodern East Asian History with Sanders - I know this isn't a HIS course but it's listed as an equivalent course, so that's a win! I liked the class, but the slides weren't very detailed. It was an enjoyable course though, I would recommend people taking this class if they want to know more about Chinese/Japanese/Korean history!

HIS202H - Gender, Race and Science

HIS280Y - History of China

So here's my situation: 

I will be commuting from Mississauga to UTSG (takes about an hour and and fifteen mins), and I plan to major in Political Science (unsure about other POSt's).

I've planned out two schedules mainly because I, as a social science admission, do not have first dibs on CSC108 and CSC148 - which I would seriously love to take - so I must wait until August 8th to enrol in those once the restrictions are dropped, and hope I get a spot! 

I was thinking of taking ECO105 instead of HIS109 , but I don't know if the content is really worth staying at school from 10 - 6.  That's where I hope you guys may help me! 

Anyway, here are the timetables:

305,324,2013,"Obstacles to a switch to an Econ major I’m in a very difficult situation.

In high school, I thought I would want to major in Political Science and History. Yet after taking ECO100 in first year (and doing quite well in it), I want to switch my Poli Sci major to Economics. Unfortunately, I didn’t take MAT 133 in first year. But double unfortunately, I also didn’t take calculus in high school (well only sort of, my math 12 class kind of included a decent amount of calculus). 

So here is my conundrum: I can’t take any ECO 2XX courses (ideally 200, 202 and 220, the least math intensive ones) in second year because I haven’t taken MAT 133. But I also can’t take them in third year and take MAT 133 in second year because I didn’t take calculus in high school.

Taking a fifth year is not really an option. University costs a boatload of money and it’s also a huge opportunity cost (ECO 100, anyone?).

To me though, it just seems ridiculous how my choices from when I was 17 are affecting me today. Isn’t U of T supposed to be a great university?!

 If it is, then why are the departments at the university so stiff? I’ve looked at my friends’ ECO 200 coursework and I seriously think I can do it. It’s not like it requires MAT 157 knowledge to be done. The only questionable part of not taking MAT 133 would be with ECO 220 which I recognize would be tougher, but definitely not impossible.

Additionally, isn’t MAT 133 really easy?  Shouldn’t I just not be able to walk on to that without taking high school calc? I know other universities have first year calculus for kids who took zero calc/math in high school.

Anyways, I’ve found this board helpful in the past and I hope its contributors can give some good advice on this one.

Thanks

I have some questions on some social sciences courses before we all go into ROSI to pick them on Monday... just to clarify before, my plan is to double major in Poli. Sci. and Crim. or Poli. Sci. and History or Crim. History. I'm not too sure yet, but those are my interests.

1) I am awful at math but I really enjoy studying economics. I like the idea of possibly doing a major in it later on but because of the math, I don't think I could do it. I didn't take Calc. or Advanced Functions in highschool... so should I take ECO100 (Into to Economics) or ECO105 (Principles of Economics for Non-Specialists)? Would I do better in ECO105 becaue there is not that much more use of math or should I take ECO100 anyways? I took Grade 12 Economics and got an 80%.

2) I heard Intro to Philosophy (PHL100) is hard... I am coming out of a school without taking an actual Philosophy course, however I studied some philosophical works in a history course I took in Grade 12. This guy I know told me the thinking is very intricate and coming out of the HS I went to, it would be tough of me (he came out of the same HS last year, took the course and had to drop it cause it was too hard). So should I take it or find something else to take?

3) Does POL100 have a tutorial? If it does, its not showing up on griddy...

4) If I decide to take ECO100 but on Thursday I want to change my mind and take ECO105, can I do that right on ROSI (same with PHL100) ? Or if I decide to go with PHL100 and first week I decide its too much, can I switch out of it (same with ECO100/ECO105)?

446,475,2013,"Painless way to set up a discussion board as a TA? So I'll be TAing for MAT135/136 this year and apparently the instructor will NOT be activating the course on blackboard, so the discussion board feature is not available (yet another failing of the blackboard software it seems). 

For a course like that it can be very convenient to allow students to post math questions online rather than requiring an individual appointment or having them wait for that one hour of tutorials a week, but inviting content-related questions over email is just asking for it. I'm wondering if anyone knows of a convenient way to set this kind of thing up? LaTeX support would be ideal but not necessary. 

Seems rather silly in this day and age to have such limited opportunity for students to ask questions when pretty much everyone is active on the internet. 

Alternatively if anyone has other ideas on convenient ways to solicit student questions then I'm all ears. 

Edit: I got the green light from the instructor to use piazza, so I've gone ahead and set up a page with that. ",MAT135,0.327881395816803,0.1814952045679092

Looking back, I spent the first two years half asleep. Didn't develop many social skills and now I'm at a loss on how to make friends because people seem to already know each other. I don't have anything to lose, so I might as well ask, is anybody in these classes willing to become note and or study buddies?

482,525,2013,"I really fucked up, need advice... I really messed up my calculus midterm... I was taking MAT135, which is supposed to be the easier math course of the ones available, and totally bombed the test. I might as well have not even gone to take it. My major is Computer Science, and I'm doing well in all my other courses but MAT135 is really bringing me down. I'm willing to put my nose to the grindstone for this class but I need to know if it is worth it. Should I just drop the course now or work really hard and end up with a barely passing mark? I've been learning the math from khanacademy and I thought I knew my stuff but, the test just blew my mind. I was not ready, and it was my fault for being so naive. I did not attend all lectures and did not speak up in tutorial when I didn't understand, just glazed over the material. I'm in a really tight spot where I don't know whether it is better for me to just drop the course and take the class later (is there even another class later?) or just work hard right now and pull through with a low mark. I'm willing to do both, but I need to know what is the better option for me first...

Edit: thanks everyone for your input, I dropped the course and will be taking it in the summer. much appreciated uoft redditors.",MAT135,0.0029714065603911,0.9581688046455384

I'm in a lecture already for MAT136, but want to change the lecture as I want to move my lab from monday to tuesday. The lab itself is full as well, but i'm pretty confident that a space will open up. However, MAT136 seems to be packed. All lectures have waitlists of 30+ people. They cancelled 2 lectures. So a few questions.

What are the odds of getting into a lecture with 56 people on the waitlist? 

should I just stay in my lecture section until the waitlists are cancelled? 

Also, will they open up more lectures seeing as how there are so many people wanting to take the course? 

Worst case scenario I can just skip 1 hour of lecture per week to get to my lab, but i'd rather not as calc is already not an area of strength for me. Also, how frowned upon is it to just attend a different lecture you're not enrolled in the whole semester? Any academic consequences? I mean the tests and quizzes are all based on being enrolled in a tutorial anyway, lectures don't really matter right? So I could technically just attend any lecture and still write/get marks for the evaluations?

I have poor foundations in higher level maths such as calculus so I automatically neglected to take 165--mainly because I wasn't even sure if I want to go into CS at all. However, I love programming and consider myself to be a decent beginner. 

However, I was looking at the lecture notes and past tests for 165 and it seems to me that its not *math* but more in the lines of logic -- which I feel I would do alright in.

So I was just wondering if anyone that has taken the course recently could just clarify if I would get completely destroyed in the course or would do alright if I ask questions and try hard.

&gt;Interest in Computer Science has increased dramatically in the last few years, and has reached a point where we no longer have enough spaces in our courses or labs to accommodate all of the students who want to take our courses. 

&gt;As a result, we will be limiting enrolment in all of our programs. We are doing this to ensure that students enrolled in a CS program can take the courses that they need in order to complete their program, and to ensure that we can continue to provide a good learning environment. We really regret turning away students who want to study Computer Science, but the alternative of long waiting lists, even longer lines at office hours, and reduced teaching quality would be even worse.

&gt;The planned limited enrolment policy for Computer Science programs is going through the approval process, but everything should be confirmed by the end of November.  We wanted to make you aware of this  change as early as possible to help you with your planning.

&gt;In the spring of 2014, you will be eligible to apply to enrol in a major, specialist, or minor in Computer Science if you have completed CSC148 and CSC165/CSC240 with high enough grades.

I am currently in possession of your Samsung smartphone, where I found it unattended at MP202, after Daniel James' lecture (PHY151) at approximately 1200 hours, when everyone was leaving. I did not want to take chances of giving it to a random person, so I have it right now.

I will be inside the exam center, by the front entrance (I think ?), until 1330 hours, where I hope to see you come by to reacquire your phone, after you unlock the phone via the ""swipe the screen"" thingy (I tried unlocking it and succeeded, so I want to see you do so as well, to confirm). I have done nothing to your phone, or the contents inside, and I will not ask any other questions. If you do not show up by then, I will leave, still in possession of your phone, to my next class. If I leave, just give me a message and we will try to meet up.

If you have any questions or comments, please comment or message me.

Hope to see you! (:



I should mentioned that it happened today (November 20, 2013)~


edit: I will ask two confirmation question, just to make sure I am not giving the phone to a hooligan, regarding phone security (swiping) and the phone owner's identity, which I saw

edit 2 (4 hours later): after realizing how much of an idiot I am for not thinking of using the other contacts before, like you wonderful people and others on Facebook suggested, i did call the number of her mom to tell her, and it just so happens that she was going to OISE anyways later in the day (this was at ~1300 hours); so at ~1700 hours, after my lab was done, i went to OISE, saw her mom, and she confirmed to me that it was her daughter's phone via spoken name (matched the one on the phone), so her mom now has it safe and sound~

To Jamie and Shawnee/Shawny/Shawni/Seani (?) R, hope the phone is in good condition lol

1. File a late withdrawal, and fill in for it by doing another course some other semester.

2. Stay until the end, take the final, and take a hit on my GPA. :/

What do you guys think? Do I have any other options? &gt;.&gt;

510,553,2013,"Questions about PEY (CS student) There isn't much info kicking around about PEY so I figured I'd ask here and see if anyone knew.

I'm a second year CS student, and I took a reduced course load this semester because I was working. I only ended up taking CSC207 this semester (of my CS courses). 

I want to plan out my courses correctly in case I want to do PEY. I haven't taken Calc yet, so these are my options:

-take calc next semester and over the summer, do 236 and 263 and STA247 next year, OR

-take 236 next semester and calc next year, and then 263 the year after.

The reason I ask is because most of the courses I want to take don't require 263. Is 263 really necessary to take before PEY, or can I take it fourth year? I heard some people wait till fourth year to take 263, but I don't know if those same people did PEY as well. Not taking a summer course would mean more time to work on personal CS projects (like an app or something similar), and allows me an extra slot next year to take another CS course (like 309 or 324). I'd rather get 236 out of the way this year, because next year I am taking 369, which I heard is very time intensive.

523,566,2013,"Questions about MAT133 Hey all:

I'm a first year planning on specializing in political science. However, I realized it would be advantageous for me to gain some transferrable skills in other areas, so I thought a good idea would be to take up a STEM minor. My idea was to do so in statistical sciences. Is this a good idea? Are there any statsci students out there who could tell me a little about the department?

Here's where the problems enter in. Obviously, the courses are math related, and since I did not take MAT133 this year (a prereq of the minor program), I would have to take it next year or in the summer. However, the prereq for MAT133 is high school Advanced Functions and Calculus; I never took those courses. Due to scheduling conflicts, I only took up to high school Functions. I was never poor in the subject -- I finished in the low to mid eighty percent range. So another question would be whether it is possible at all to take MAT courses without the high school prerequisites? I know the department specifies they are required, but do they force you out if you do not complete them? 

Since I only have one exam this semester, I've been taking time to learn the material from the high school courses I missed, and that seems to be going well. But will that be enough? I'm told MAT133 in specifics is fairly easy compared to most of the other courses offered, considering this is financial math, but will I hope to survive without officially taking the prereqs?

I was wondering is if anyone else has went through double probation and what you recommend I do? At this point I'm very flustered.

I'm an English major who decided to add a computer science subject post to her degree in order to increase job prospects. Since I'm not in first year, I will be charged retroactive program fees... My tuition will be 22K next year if I want to major in CS.

So, my plan is to minor in computer science instead and avoid the fees. However, CS minors are limited to three 300 level CS half courses. If you could pick the three most useful 300 level CSC courses for employment prospects, what would they be?

I'm an English major who decided to add a computer science subject post to her degree in order to increase job prospects. Since I'm not in first year, I will be charged retroactive program fees... My tuition will be 22K next year if I want to major in CS.

So, my plan is to minor in computer science instead and avoid the fees. However, CS minors are limited to three 300 level CS half courses. If you could pick the three most useful 300 level CSC courses for employment prospects, what would they be?

I'm a MAT 137 instructor and I'll be giving an open lecture to help first year calculus students understand proofs. Students tend to think that ""proofs"" are the hardest part of a first year course (""I can't do proofs"", ""Proof questions are hard"", ""Please no more proofs"").

I understand. When I was a first-year student I learned proofs in the worst way possible (memorizing the words with 0 understanding); no one told me how to learn these things.

This lecture will go through the basics of how you should get from seeing a proof, to reading a proof, to understanding a proof, to *owning* a proof. This should be an empowering lecture that will take you from ""Ugh, seriously, I don't know how to do proof questions - lol"" to ""It seems natural that the integral form of the Taylor series remainder is derived through induction and integration by parts.""

The requirements are a ""average of at least 70% in the two required first year courses"", which Economics 100 or 105 and HIS103 (Statecraft and Strategy). 

I'm fairly sure in HIS103 I'll end up with roughly a 75% and in ECO105 my mark could range from 65%-70%, so Ill have a combined average of a low 70%, I also have a few extra-curriculars.

So for anyone that can help I have a few questions:

1. If my combined average is a 70%, will that enough to be accepted (as I hear IR is a competitive program).

2. Can I/Should I redo economics to get a better grade?

3. If I dont get accepted this year can I apply next year, when I have more volunteer and extra-curriculars done, or can I apply only once? ",ECO105,0.0691698119044303,0.0366834811866283

693,741,2014,"Should I do a LWD and have 3.5 Credits? I'm a first year student. Earlier in the year I dropped EAS100 which left me with only 4 credits, and right now I'm at a big risk of failing psych (I need a 71% on the final). If I drop psych it will leave me with only 3.5 credits. Will this effect my status as a full time student, my OSAP loans, or anything else?  

Also I'm already planning to do a 5th year, so I can get all the majors/minors I want, so waiting a year to do my subject post isnt a problem.

So I've been offered a position for ROP299, and have been given the choice to choose between doing it in the summer or the fall with a specific researcher. Are they usually pretty difficult? I've heard that they're extremely time-consuming. It's in MGY, which kind of has a rep for having hard classes to begin with.

A student completed a CSC343 (Databases) paper on April 16 2014 and found it too hard.

He made this thread on the course discussion board to vent his frustration:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/ci24gv7hb0yadrj/epic%20fail%20thread%20page%201.pdf

He simultaneously made this Facebook post:
http://imgur.com/3fCZu6N

After being told off by the course TA (on the discussion board) and by another student (on Facebook), the student decides to remove his Facebook post and the thread. However, the TA saved one page of the thread (the other page was lost but had only one post from the TA himself - exposing the FB post), while another student saved the FB post in a screenshot just before the student deleted it.

Also the TA retaliated by editing one of this student's old threads to ""resurrect"" what was deleted: https://csc.cdf.toronto.edu/mybb/showthread.php?tid=8922

Thoughts? I sure as hell would never want to work with this student in class or hire him in my company.

Edit: i don't know the guy and the drop box link is not mine. I only edited the pic as some here recommended.

Two weeks ago, a friend of mine (here with me) made a post in a PSY100 group on Facebook about obtaining exam questions from other students in exchange for cash so that he could have an advantage on a postponed exam. This post was a joke, with an intention to elicit a response from the membership of the group. Many false details were included, as well as a questionable dialogue in the comment section. This friend is not enrolled in PSY100, and this ""deffered exam"" did not exist. Today he had a meeting with the registrar, which turned out to be a surprise ""interview"" regarding the report made pursuant to the previous thread. He explained the following:

-He is not enrolled in PSY100.

-The mentioned location of the deferred exam (Mining building) was false and fabricated.

-The mentioned time of the deferred exam (2pm the same day) was false and completely insensible, as deferred exams take place in a future exam period. 

Given the circumstances, there were no consequences for him other than a simple ""don't do this again because it becomes a pain in the ass for us"". This Facebook cheating saga has been fun for all of us, and I figured you guys might want an update.

1. I suck at math, or at least I've been convinced that my entire high school career. I got 70s in high school math courses and never took calculus in my life.

Should I go back to school and do all the grade 12 math prerequisites before considering anything in CS? 

As for me, I'm a second-year student at UTM majoring in English and possibly Professional Writing. English isn't my favourite or best subject, but it's something I'm alright at. My grades in high school have never been *that* good and I avoided science and math-related courses because I've always been really crappy at both. In elementary school, my parents took me to a private clinic where I was diagnosed with a learning disability in math. In both elementary and middle school, I was sent to a separate classroom for kids with special needs during normal math class because of how slow I was. In high school I took M-level math courses and only barely managed to pass them. My ability in math is so bad that I still count on my fingers. I can't even do basic sums in my head.

I'm attending university because I want a job, but I know I won't get one easily if I go down the pure humanities route. I'm not a proactive person and I'm really bad at networking, so I know I won't be able to make my major work unless I have a STEM-related field to supplement it. At the very least, I might be able to land a job as a technical writer if I minor in CS. ",MAT102,0.1552368402481079,0.4856711030006408

I've taken CS proofs courses (165 and 236) so I feel rather comfortable with proofs. I would like to get calculus over with. I took it last year with Lam and I did not like the structure of the course at all.

My question is, is MAT137 leaps and bounds harder than MAT135/136? I understand it's a little more theoretical and has proofs. On the other hand, the stretched out time-span (it being a full year course) and the way the marks are distributed means it would be a little bit more forgiving in terms of fixing one poor result.

I am starting my second year now, and I am planning to graduate in 4 years, so do you think it would be manageable? PSY100 wasn't really light in terms of workload (specifically the readings) but it wasn't as technical as some Comp Sci courses, so I am wondering how would it work in the future?

So I've got two course slots left. Are there any must-take CS courses I should do or can I do pre-med requirements in those? (I was planning on doing CSC209 next summer.) Anything to keep in mind for these courses, since I'm still trying to maintain a med school-competitive GPA? How are my course choices, given my goals and situation?

Course enorollment for next year is coming up and I noticed that all courses have been uploaded into ROSi. I went to go and see if the courses I have picked for next year were good to go but I encountered a few problems. Before I move on I must say I am pursuing a major in Political Science and double minor in Canadian Studies and American Studies.

I am taking HIS271 (American History since 1607) and when I went to check the timetable space I got a message saying ""You do not fit in any enrolment category. There are 300 total spaces in the meeting section"". Why do I not fit into any enrolment category for this course? I'm doing a minor in American Studies so I should be able to take this course. I have to take this course considering POL203 is not being offered anymore and I can't take USA200 because it is not a pre-requisite for USA300, a course I am required to take for my minor (HIS271 is a pre-requisite for this course). If no one has an answer, who should I contact? 

I am also taking STA201 (to complete a breadth requirement) and UNI268 (for my Canadian Studies minor) however when I went to check the timetable space on ROSi it says that both courses are not offered. However when I go to the actual U of T Faculty of Statistics and Canadian Studies websites it says that both courses are being offered. Again, if no one has an answer who should I contact?

984,1050,2014,"Worth taking CSC321 before CSC411? Hi, I'm a CS specialist planning on doing a focus in AI, including machine learning as one of the areas used towards the focus. Now I see that this requires the following courses:

- CSC321H1    Introduction to Neural Networks and Machine Learning
- CSC411H1    Machine Learning and Data Mining
- CSC412H1    Probabilistic Learning and Reasoning

I'm just wondering, how important is it to take CSC321 before CSC411? From the course descriptions it looks like they cover related topics with some overlap, and the impression I get is that CSC411 is like an advanced follow-up course. However, CSC411 doesn't have CSC321 as a prerequisite, and it is not even listed as ""recommended preparation"", so I'm wondering how necessary it is to take one before the other.

Also, if I were to go straight for CSC411/412 without completing CSC321, would the department still allow that to be counted towards the specialist? The requirement is 2.5 FCE covering at least two of the four areas, does that mean I have to entirely cover the area, or could I replace CSC321 with say 401 or 320?
